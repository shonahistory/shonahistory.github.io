                  The core of each of the Shona chiefdoms or principalities is a
                  clan. This is a group of
                  <abbr
                    style="user-select: none"
                    tip="Related on or descended from the father's or male side"
                    >agnatically</abbr
                  >
                  related kinsmen and kinswomen who trace their descent from a
                  common founding father, a <em>sikarudzi</em> (creator of the
                  tribe). The chief is the member of this lineage who has
                  succeeded to the position of the founding father, who rules
                  with his approval, and who cares for his descendants. The
                  lineage has its territory of which its members are the
                  <em>varidzi</em> (owners).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their common ownership is a bequest from the founder to his
                  descendants. In the past, title to legitimate occupation was
                  conferred by the Rozvi to the chiefs subject to them by virtue
                  of their conquest and hegemony. Nowadays chiefdoms occupy land
                  in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acts of the
                  government.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The chief is the senior member of the clan, in status, if not
                  in age. He inherits the traditional title of his
                  chieftainship. Thus, for example, the names Mangwende, Makoni
                  and Mutasa, chiefs respectively of the Nhowe, Hungwe and
                  Manyika peoples, are hereditary titles. They date back at
                  least three centuries as we know from Portuguese records.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The name of the <em>varidzi vevhu</em> (owners of the soil) is
                  usually also the name of the territory in which they live.
                  Thus the Hungwe under Makoni live in MaHungwe, the Manyika
                  under Mutasa live in Manyika, the Mbire under Svosve live in
                  Mbire, the Shawasha under Chinamhora in ChiShawasha, the
                  Njanja in ZviNjanja, the Pfungwe under chief Chitsungo in
                  Pfungwe, the Nhohwe under Mangwende in Nhohwe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each member of the clan inherits his totem (<em>mutupo</em>),
                  its principal praise name (<em>chidawo</em>), and its set of
                  praises (<em>nhetembo dzerudzi</em>). These provide both men
                  and women with an important part of their identity, and
                  outsiders with ritual means to show them proper respect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clansmen and women refer to themselves by their totem. Thus
                  the Shawasha says of himself, "<em>Ndiri Soko</em>" (I am a
                  Soko viz, a member of the group that is identified with the
                  baboon and monkey, and which treats them as taboo). They use
                  their principal praise name or names in addition if they need
                  to differentiate themselves and their group from others who
                  have the same totem, but different principal praise names.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, "<em>Ndiri Soko Murehwa</em>" (I am a Soko with
                  the praise name Murehwa, viz. One spoken about and therefore
                  famous) These groups which have totems in common with others,
                  but different praise names, are normally referred to as
                  sub-clans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The totem, being sacred to clansmen and women, provides them
                  with an oath, usually accompanied by the words
                  <em>baba</em> (father) or <em>sekuru</em> (grandfather), for
                  example, "<em>Nababa wangu Soko!</em>" (by my father Soko). It
                  also supplies the imagery and a good deal of the content of
                  the clan praises.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The members of the clan share a common mythological and
                  historical account of their beginnings as a clan or sub-clan.
                  A good many of their traditions, and of the clan praises as
                  well, deal with the names and burial places of deceased
                  ancestors. These burial places, the places where the clan
                  dwelt in the past and left its dead, remain sacred, even
                  though they lie outside the present clan territory. The graves
                  of more recent ancestors will usually lie within the clan
                  territory, and are also mentioned in clan praises.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The world of the ancestors is referred to as
                  <em>Pasi</em> (the ground, the world below).
                  <em>Pasi</em> connotes at least those ancestors whom the
                  people remember, and with whom they are in effective contact.
                  The fact that the founding father has left his descendants
                  their land, and that he and other ancestors lie buried in it,
                  constitutes a very real bond between the clan and its
                  territory. A man in his own country is called
                  <em>mwana wevhu</em> (child of the soil), and this name
                  distinguishes him from those whose links with the land are not
                  so close.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The founding fathers and the other ancestors live on with
                  their descendants in the same land, and communicate with them
                  through spirit possession, dreams, and other types of
                  visitation, such as sickness, which require the interpretation
                  of a diviner. Communication is made according to the degree of
                  the relationship and the seniority of the ancestor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ancestors who are related to the whole of the clan, as
                  opposed to smaller lineage groups, communicate with their
                  descendants through a tribal medium selected by them and of a
                  different totem. His presence and services are secured by the
                  clan by a transfer of cattle reminiscent of
                  <a
                    href="./../../../../2011/10/07/the-function-of-roora-in-zimbabwe"
                    ><em>roora</em> </a
                  >(marriage consideration).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course people other than clansmen and women live under the
                  jurisdiction of the chiefs and, indeed, usually outnumber
                  them. In the first place the wives of clansmen are required to
                  be of other clans or sub-clans, marriage among the Shona being
                  exogamous and, on the whole, patrilocal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The family from which a clansman's wife comes must have a
                  different totem or a different principal praise name from his.
                  Marriage within the sub-clan would constitute incest
                  (<em>makunakuna</em>), a sin which is offensive to the
                  founding father and punished by him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clansmen belonging to clans other than that of the chief, and
                  who live under his jurisdiction, are called <em>vatorwa</em>,
                  <em>vasokeri</em>, or <em>vauyi</em>. Being outside the ruling
                  lineage, they look to ancestral spirits of their own, either
                  to their founding father, where their group lives in its own
                  land, or to the nearer circle of family spirits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The country of the ruling lineage, if large enough, is
                  administered by districts, each district being composed of
                  villages, and each village of hamlets. The Shona nomenclature
                  reflects the structure. The chief (<em>ishe</em>) of a
                  territory (<em>nyika</em>) is called <em>sanyika</em> (master
                  of the land). The administrative head of a district
                  (<em>dunhu</em>), normally a kinsmen, is called
                  <em>sadunhu</em>. The head of a village (<em>musha</em>) is
                  called <em>samusha</em> or, because he keeps the tax register,
                  <em>sabhuku</em>. The head of a hamlet is called
                  <em>samana,</em> and a household head <em>saimba</em>. If
                  <em>vatorwa</em> form a sufficiently numerous group, they may
                  constitute a <em>dunhu</em> with a <em>sadunhu</em> of their
                  own lineage. The qualification for these positions of
                  leadership is lineal seniority in the group concerned, though
                  disabilities of age may be a limiting factor.

                  The clan as a lineage group is concerned with its perpetuity
                  and the transmission of its life. Clan praises contain
                  references to the sexual attractiveness of its members which
                  draws women to them, ready to become their wives. The clan
                  praises include a special sub-genre in honor of its unmarried
                  daughters which celebrate their attractions to potential
                  husbands.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In such poems mention is made of the clan's founders on the
                  female side, namely the sister of the founding father, and the
                  sisters of successive founders of sub-clans. These women are
                  known as <em>zimbuya guru</em> (great ancestress),
                  <em>mbonga</em> (dedicated woman), <em>zisarumbuya</em>, or
                  <em>vamoyo</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their names are invoked to thank them for their continued
                  influence on the daughters of the clan, to pray for its
                  continuance, and to recall the values for which they stand to
                  the minds of the present generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>mbonga</em> is the repository and the model of womanly
                  qualities of which the clan desires to see its daughters
                  possessed so that its name may be honored wherever the women
                  go as wives. These qualities include traits of character which
                  are mentioned among the clan praises, but also, and more
                  important, moral and physical preparedness for married life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In clan traditions the <em>sikarudzi</em> and his sister, the
                  <em>zimbuya guru</em>, stand at the beginning of its life. The
                  new clan life required the dedication of a sister to an
                  unmarried life as a <em>mbonga</em> consecrated to the
                  safeguarding of the clans's charms which enabled it to govern
                  and administer the land, and protect it against the hazards of
                  war, hunting, and sickness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These charms, <em>makona</em>, achieved their potency from the
                  substances which were their ingredients, and they were
                  strengthened by an act of sexual intercourse between brother
                  and sister.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An example of the formation of a new branch, <em>dungwe</em>,
                  is recalled in the traditions of the Mutumba chieftaincy. This
                  branch stems from that of Chihota, which itself stems from the
                  line of Mutasa, chief of the Manyika. All three lineages have
                  the same totem, Tembo, but the principal praise names of the
                  two junior lines differ from that of the senior. Mutasa's
                  chidawo is Samaita, while that of Chihota and Mutumba is
                  Mazvimbakupa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tradition recalled that the leader of the Mutumba line came
                  from the house of Chipendo. He was chosen by the elders as
                  <em>sikarudzi</em>, founder of the line, when the group
                  decided to migrate from the country of Chihota. A new
                  <em>mbonga</em> had to be chosen from among the clanswomen,
                  and the choice fell on Nyahuva, a sister of Guvamombe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She was instructed in her duties by the <em>mbonga</em> of the
                  vaHota. Guvamombe and Nyahuva had to prepare and consecrate
                  new charms between them, <em>kupinga makona</em>, for the
                  protection of the new branch. The charms reputedly consisted
                  of various <em>mazango</em>, the ingredients of which were
                  kept secret.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These were subsidiary charms, each with its own purpose, and
                  designed to meet the different dangers which threatened the
                  clan's life stemming from war, sickness, sterility, the
                  hazards of hunting, and so on.

                  In the past the office of <em>mbonga</em> was a regular one in
                  the structure of the clan. A new <em>mbonga</em> would be
                  chosen from among the clanswomen to succeed to the office upon
                  the death of her predecessor, though, during the interregnum,
                  the duty of keeping the clan's charms would devolve upon the
                  chief, who delegated it to his second wife, the
                  <em>mukaranga</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>mbonga's</em> main tasks were the safeguarding of the
                  clan's charms and the preparation of the young women of the
                  clan for marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The charms were kept in granaries, though, on occasion, also
                  on the <em>mbonga's</em> person. One in particular, a duiker's
                  horn in which the <em>hwanga </em>was kept, was always worn
                  around her neck. This was a charm which enabled the clan to
                  evade its enemies after a defeat by becoming invisible to
                  them, and by opening up to them a route of escape through a
                  fissure in the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On hunting expeditions the mbonga could accompany her brothers
                  and live at the hunting camp, <em>musasa</em>, with her
                  bodyguard. She kept the hunting charm by her on these
                  occasions. She was also responsible for keeping a drum by her
                  side which was beaten in order to recall her brothers to the
                  camp and tell them where it was.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The potency of the clan charms had to be renewed every new
                  moon. This was a responsibility of the clan elders and of a
                  sister's son or daughter, <em>dunzvi</em>. The diviner had no
                  part to play in this essentially group responsibility and
                  ritual. Certain powders and oils were required, and, of
                  course, the blessing of the ancestors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>mbonga</em> was also responsible for the training of
                  the the young women of the clan for marriage. This included
                  both moral and physical preparation. Girls were expected to be
                  chaste. They were subject to surveillance and periodic
                  inspection to ensure that, when they married, their husband's
                  clan would send back the <em>mombe yemachiti,</em> a token of
                  gratitude for the new wife's upbringing and that she had been
                  found to be a virgin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The training also included tuition in the symbolic and
                  culinary niceties of married life such as the preparation of
                  <em>kamutsa nedako</em>, an early morning delicacy, and
                  <em>chinamu</em>, another for the evening, after the men had
                  left the <em>dare</em>, the village meeting place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A new <em>mbonga</em> or <em>mbonga</em>-designate had to
                  spend some time at the <em>Mabwe aDziva</em> (the Rocks of
                  Dziva), where the shrines of
                  <a href="./../../../../2014/07/26/mwari">Mwari </a>are to this
                  day. There she took her place among the
                  <em>vakadzi vaMwari</em> (the wives of Mwari). As a woman
                  dedicated to Mwari she was able to learn her role in the
                  clan's life, particularly as it affected her responsibilities
                  to her sisters.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The traditions mention the suffering which
                  <em>mbonga</em> incurred at the hands and from the tongues of
                  their brothers' wives, and could lead to their suicide. This
                  was occasioned by criticism of favoritism and partiality made
                  by mothers of girls who were jealous of others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>mbonga</em> were assisted in their work by women in
                  different districts to whom could be delegated part of their
                  responsibilities in regard to the clan's daughters. These were
                  called <em>zitete</em> and to them responsibility for the
                  clan's daughters seems to have passed today. For example, if a
                  wife wishes to visit here <em>zitete</em> because she is
                  confused or ignorant about some aspect of her wifely duty, her
                  husband must allow her to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Boys and young men were also, of course, trained in the
                  qualities expected of them. The herding groups and the
                  <em>dare</em> were the training ground and forum for clan
                  virtues and values.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instruction in the duties of a husband was given to boys by
                  their mother's brothers, <em>madzisekuru</em>, and their
                  wives, <em>madzimbuya</em>. The mother's brother was also
                  responsible for giving his nephews the medicines required for
                  their development over puberty,
                  <em>mishonga yemusana</em> (medicines for the back).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wives at their husbands' homes always retain their own totem,
                  although, in most groups, they are addressed by their
                  husband's principal praise name. Thus the wife of a Tembo
                  clansman of the Chihota chiefdoms will normally be addressed
                  by her husband, and even by her own clans people, as
                  Mazvimbakupa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, a wife always retains the support of her clansmen,
                  especially her father and brothers, and, ideally, the
                  bride-wealth paid to her family to secure her absorption as
                  wife into her husband's clan is liable to forfeiture should
                  she be forced to leave her husband through no fault of her
                  own. This support involves, of course, the continual
                  protection of the ancestral spirits of her clan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The clan spirits of both husband and wife are present at the
                  act of conjugal intercourse, and are invoked in the praises
                  which the spouses exchange at this time. This occasion is, in
                  a very real sense, the meeting of two clans, and demands its
                  appropriate ritual of acknowledgment and thanks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The proportion of lines in this poetry which deals with the
                  spouse, compared with those which deal with his or her clan,
                  varies from occasion to occasion, but it seems that the aspect
                  of ancestral gift in the person of the spouse, and of
                  ancestral help in the formation and protection of new life, is
                  not neglected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Likeness to a paternal grandfather will betoken a special
                  moulding influence on his part in the very life and substance
                  of the child. Likeness to a maternal ancestor will show that
                  her clan spirits were particularly near at the moment of
                  conception.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the child grows, the interest of the spirits on both sides
                  continues. The traditional songs used by mothers to quiet
                  their children invoke both groups, for either may be
                  responsible for making their wishes felt through making the
                  babies cry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>THE FATHER'S CLAN</strong><br />
                  As a child grows and is absorbed into the clan, it learns to
                  group the people who surround it into classes of kin and
                  non-kin. Each class of person has its term of address and
                  response according to the relationship involved, and these
                  verbal exchanges are but part of the range of patterns of
                  manners which the child has to learn as it grows up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within the clan the child's relationship to clansmen differs
                  according to generation, and these different relationships are
                  marked by different terms. Thus the father's father is called
                  <em>sekuru</em> (or sometimes <em>tateguru</em>), and so are
                  all clansmen coeval with him. Coeval clanswomen are called
                  <em>ambuya</em> (grandmother) as are the wives of all
                  <em>madzisekuru</em> (grandfathers). The child is called
                  <em>muzukuru</em> (grandchild) by all these people. The
                  husbands of clanswomen called <em>ambuya</em> are
                  <em>vakuwasha</em>. They call their wives's grand-nephews
                  <em>tezvara</em>, and their grand-nieces, <em>muramu</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clansmen of the fathers generation are called
                  <em>baba</em> (father), and clanswomen are called
                  <em>tete</em> (or sometimes <em>samukadzi</em>) - paternal
                  aunt. Their spouses are called, respectively,
                  <em>amai</em> (mother) and
                  <em>mukuwasha</em> (relative-in-law, usually male). Fathers
                  and mothers call the child <em>mwana</em>, the paternal aunt
                  calls it <em>muzukuru</em>, and the <em>mukuwasha</em> calls
                  it <em>tezvara</em> or <em>muramu</em> (male or female
                  relative-in-law)
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the child's own generation the siblings of its own sex are
                  distinguished on the basis of age, but there is a single term
                  for siblings of the other sex. The terms <em>mukoma</em> and
                  <em>munun'una</em> are correlative terms for siblings of the
                  same sex, the term <em>hanzvadzi</em> a mutual term between
                  siblings of different sex.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, within the clan, generations are marked by the use of
                  special terms. The factor of sex is one which tempers the
                  relations of respect and subordination between members. Thus
                  relations between a father's sister, <em>tete</em>, and her
                  brother's children, <em>vazukuru</em>, are relaxed. But those
                  between siblings of the opposite sex, <em>hanzvadzi</em>, are
                  not.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus kinsmen, <em>hama</em>, of the clan are divided into
                  those with whom converse is relaxed and those with whom it is
                  constrained. The former are called <em>vasekedzani</em> (those
                  who joke together) and consist of members of alternate and of
                  the same generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The exception is the relation between
                  <em>hanzvadzi</em> (siblings of opposite sexes) the latter are
                  <em>vanyarikani</em> (those who are shy of one another), and
                  consist of members of proximate generations. The exception is
                  the relation between children and their father's sister. Both
                  <em>vasekedzani</em> and <em>vanyarikani</em>, however, feel
                  bound by the ties of clan membership.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This solidarity shows itself in the ready acceptance of
                  members of the clan, no matter where they live, and in
                  hospitality. Responsibility for brother's children is
                  axiomatic, for example in the provision of education and
                  bride-wealth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>THE MOTHER'S CLAN</strong><br />
                  The child is differentially related to members of the clan
                  into which it is born though they share the same blood. This
                  is due mainly to the relations of authority and subordination
                  between members of parental and filial generations. In regard
                  to its mother's clan the child has only two relations,
                  distinguished by sex. The men of the mother's clan are all
                  called <em>sekuru</em>, and the women are called
                  <em>amai</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dealings between children and their mother's male kin,
                  particularly the mother's own brothers, is relaxed and
                  intimate. These <em>madzisekuru</em> call their sister's or
                  daughter's children by the same term as the paternal
                  grandfather and the the paternal aunts do, namely,
                  <em>vazukuru</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Maternal uncles and sister's children are
                  <em>vasekedzani</em>, even more than in the relaxed relations
                  of the paternal kin, since the mother's clan represents love
                  and indulgence without authority and the need for
                  subordination and solidarity due to clan interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Children call their mother's clanswomen <em>amai</em>. They
                  are <em>vanyarikani</em> since they share to some extent the
                  responsible relation of their sister to her children.
                  Seniority within the mother's generation is as marked as it is
                  in the father's. Mothers senior to the child's own mother are
                  <em>mai guru</em> (senior mother) and the juniors are called
                  <em>mai nini</em> (junior mother).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The simplicity of the relations between children and the
                  members of their mother's clan, as reflected in the use of
                  only two terms, seems to indicate that clans are seen by
                  outsiders as unitary. Relation to one member of a clan
                  involves relations with all members. In the relations with
                  members of other clans sex is a far more important
                  differentiating factor than age or generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fathers' sisters and mothers' brothers play hardly less vital
                  a part in the education of their brothers'and sisters'
                  children than do fathers and mothers themselves. A
                  <em>sekuru</em> is at home in the village of his
                  <em>muzukuru</em>. The <em>muzukuru</em> also enjoys much
                  freedom at his <em>sekuru's</em> village.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He may help himself to his <em>sekuru's</em> clothes and, in
                  jest, threaten to run away with his wife who is his
                  <em>ambuya</em>. He relies on his <em>sekuru</em> and
                  <em>tete</em> for help in courtship, and for advice on sexual
                  matters and married life. Similarly the <em>tete</em> is the
                  normal confidant and chaperone for a girl in matters
                  concerning her marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>sekuru</em> and <em>tete</em> are entitled and obliged
                  to reprimand their nephews and nieces, and this may involve
                  detailed comment on their loose behavior if it exists, in a
                  way which would be improper and undignified for parents to do.
                  The <em>sekuru</em> plays a highly important part in the
                  education and correction of the children in a friendly and
                  jocular way. He may take the part of the children against
                  their parents and they value his friendship and feel confident
                  and welcome at his home.

                  <strong>THE SPOUSE'S CLAN</strong><br />
                  A man is related in two ways to the members of his wife's
                  clan. All her kinsmen are called <em>tezvara</em> by him, the
                  term applying particularly to her own father and brothers. Her
                  clanswomen, particularly her own sisters, are <em>varamu</em>,
                  a mutual term.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A man's <em>madzitezvara</em> (kinsmen-in-law) are
                  <em>vanyarikani</em>, a relationship which extends to his
                  wife's own mother, <em>vambuya</em>. All these relatives call
                  him <em>mukuwasha</em>. A man's relations with his wife's
                  kinswomen are easy and relaxed, and they use a reciprocal term
                  to one another, <em>muramu</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A woman is somewhat differently related to her husband's kin.
                  His fathers are called <em>tezvara</em> by her, and his
                  mothers and sisters <em>vamwene</em>. They call her
                  <em>muroora</em>. They are <em>vanyarikani</em> to her
                  especially the husband's own father and mother. His brothers,
                  however, are <em>vasekedzani</em>, and the reciprocal term
                  <em>muramu</em> is used between them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His children are her <em>vana</em> and they call her
                  <em>amai</em>. His grandparents are her <em>sekuru</em> and
                  <em>ambuya</em>, and they call her <em>muzukuru</em>. Thus a
                  wife is deferentially involved in the internal relations of
                  her husband's clan much more than he is in those of his wife,
                  at least as far as kinship terminology is concerned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the village community the child finds people of other clans
                  who are not related to him. His relationship with these
                  <em>vatorwa</em> is polite, somewhat between shyness and
                  familiarity. Among them he will find his <em>shamwari</em>,
                  friends of his own sex, his girlfriends, and probably, his
                  eventual marriage partner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Marriage between neighbors who knew each other,
                  <em>vematongo</em>, was favored over marriage with strangers.
                  These relationships bring with them, of course, their own more
                  familiar forms of speech.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most familiar and unrestrained relation in Shona life are
                  those between <em>madzisahwira</em> (priviledged joking
                  friends). There is not the same freedom of choice within this
                  relation as within the relation of
                  <em>ushamwari</em> (friendship) since it is primarily a
                  relation between clans before becoming, in particular cases, a
                  relation between persons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most concrete service which a <em>sahwira</em> renders is
                  to bury a co-<em>sahwira</em>, but this service is preceded
                  during life by a very uninhibited and jocular relation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is reflected in a number of poems in this collection.
                  Because <em>madzisahwira</em> may take extreme liberties with
                  one another, their services are available to other people
                  should there be a need to convey criticism or a desire for
                  reconciliation, a need to ask a favor, or make known a
                  grievance to a partner in the joking relation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This <em>sahwira</em> is allowed and expected to be direct and
                  pointed in his criticism of the behavior of his
                  co-<em>sahwira</em>, and the latter may not take offense.
