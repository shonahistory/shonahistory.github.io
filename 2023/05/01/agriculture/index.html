                <p>
                  To appreciate the full impact of colonisation on the African
                  agricultural sector, it is necessary to understand the
                  geography of the country. It is divided into three main
                  regions: the fertile highveld, the middleveld, and the hot,
                  arid lowveld.
                </p>
                <figure class="size-full">
                  <img loading="lazy" src="rho.webp" alt="Rhodesia" />
                </figure>
                <p>
                  The highveld comprises land over 1,200 meters in altitude, and
                  runs north-east to south-east across the centre of the
                  country. The land in this region is predominantly flat, and
                  forms the watershed between the Zambezi, Limpopo and Sabi
                  rivers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This area is the most fertile of the three main regions, and
                  receives the largest portion of the rainfall. The highveld
                  forms 25 percent of the entire country, and it was in this
                  area that the Ndebele, and later the white settlers, chose to
                  live.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bordering the highveld on the north-west and south-east lies
                  the middleveld. This land ranges between 900 and 1,200 meters
                  in altitude. In some places the middleveld is flat,
                  particularly from Bulawayo to the area near Hwange, where the
                  railway runs in a straight line for nearly seventy-two miles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The major portion of the middleveld, however, is far more
                  undulating than the highveld; it comprises 40 percent of the
                  country and most of the African reserves were to be
                  established in this area.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, beyond the middleveld lies the hot, arid and often
                  malarial lowveld. This area consists of the Zambezi and
                  Sabi-Limpopo valleys; the latter, predominantly flat country,
                  and the former, mountainous. The lowveld comprises 35 percent
                  of the country, and most of the land in this region is below
                  900 meters in altitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was not attractive to human settlement, lack of rain making
                  it difficult to cultivate crops and tsetse fly inhibiting the
                  breeding of cattle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are two major soil types to be found. The predominant
                  soils are the light sandveld variety, which are of low
                  inherent fertility, and constitute 70 percent of the country's
                  soil.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These sandy soils are to be found mainly in the middle- and
                  lowveld, the areas in which most of the African reserves were
                  to be situated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The heavier red and brown loam and clay soils comprise 7
                  percent, and are found primarily on the highveld, the
                  principal area of white settlement. These soils are of a much
                  higher fertility than the sandy soils.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are also two principal tribes: the Shona and the
                  Ndebele. Although there were differences in their cultural
                  communities in the nineteenth century, both tribes practised
                  methods of shifting cultivation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This system was not as inefficient and primitive as the
                  settlers, and later historians, believed. If one looks at the
                  agricultural prospects prior to the arrival of the white
                  settlers in 1890, taking into consideration climatic
                  conditions - erratic rainfall and the nature of the soil, in
                  conjunction with population-land ratios and the needs of the
                  people - it becomes increasingly apparent that the general
                  consensus as to the nature of African agricultural methods is
                  grossly inaccurate.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The methods of cultivation used at the time Europeans moved
                    into the area were remote from those evolved by Jethro Tull,
                    the father of the European agricultural revolution. Because
                    there was no use for intensive land use, low yielding
                    extensive methods of production were enjoyed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This does not, however, imply that methods were inefficient;
                    rather, shifting cultivation is less a device of barbarism
                    than a concession to the character of the soil. (M.
                    Yudelman)
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  Under this system of cultivation, land was tilled continuously
                  for up to four years, whereupon it was abandoned and allowed
                  to lie fallow for a period of approximately 15 years before
                  being brought into use once more. During the interim, the
                  natural coverage was allowed sufficient time to recover.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When an area of land was selected for cultivation, all the
                  trees were cut down, with the exception of those bearing
                  edible fruit and those used for ritual purposes. The branches
                  were then piled around the remaining boles. This task was
                  undertaken by the men as only they were permitted to handle
                  the axe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The land was then hoed by the women, after which it was left
                  for a time, during which the wood piles dried out. The piles
                  of wood were then burnt and the land left untouched again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the first rains had fallen, usually in December or
                  January, planting was undertaken. There was no seed selection
                  and seeds were not planted at regular intervals, but
                  broadcast. The ashes from the burnt trees were hoed into the
                  ground as a fertilizer.

                      Although no fertilizer other than raw rock phosphate was
                      available, progressive farmers knew the value of looking
                      after the soil and green crops were grown on many farms.
                      The most popular was sunnhemp. As sunnhemp could grow six
                      foot tall ploughing it in was no easy task using oxen
                      (1914)

                <p>
                  Fields were usually planted to a variety of crops: a small
                  portion was planted to groundnuts, another to bambarra
                  groundnuts - these being grown separately. On a large part of
                  the field a mixture of sorghum (<em>mapfunde</em>), finger
                  millet (<em>rapoko</em>), bullrush millet (mhunga), curcurbits
                  and cowpeas (<em>nyimo</em>), were broadcast and hoed into the
                  soil.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although maize was grown on the same land and mixed with other
                  crops, small holes were made with the hoe, and several maize
                  seeds planted in each. This method of mixed planting, later
                  condemned by the settlers, was actually well-suited to the
                  extensive systems of agriculture employed by Africans,
                  particularly to those practised on sandy soils.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As different crops matured at different times, mixed planting
                  ensured that there was an adequate ground coverage throughout
                  the planting season, thus preventing the soil from becoming
                  scorched and dry from the fierce rays of the sun. Furthermore,
                  it ensured there would be little or no water loss through
                  run-off during periods of excessive rainfall.

                    Under conditions of thin soils and a tropical ecology, the
                    Shona were in many ways, excellent agriculturalists. Their
                    practices avoided the main problems that plague Southern
                    Rhodesia: soil erosion and declining fertility of the soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Soil erosion was reduced by thick, mixed plantings of low
                    leafy crops which leave no bare ground between grain stems,
                    while roots of tree stumps and pollarded trees held the soil
                    together. By shifting fields and letting land return to
                    bush, they avoided prolonged periods of baring soil to
                    erosion (W. Roder)
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  Thus, contrary to attitudes prevailing in the nineteenth and
                  early twentieth centuries, Africans did have well-thought out
                  reasons for the type of tillage methods they practised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  New fields were up to four acres in size, and every year
                  adjacent virgin land was brought under cultivation. After
                  approximately four seasons, the whole area would be between 4
                  and 6 acres. At that stage, a portion of the first land would
                  be abandoned and a new section added each year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this way, each portion was cultivated for about four years
                  and then allowed to revert to bush and grass. Alternatively,
                  if over time fields came to be located too far from the
                  village, the entire village was moved to a new site.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This system of cultivation had a carrying capacity of 20
                  persons per square mile, of which 25 percent was cultivated, 5
                  percent wasteland, and the remainder was grazing land.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before the penetration of whites, when human and cattle
                  numbers were sufficiently low relative to the availability of
                  land, this system could be carried out effectively. Yields
                  were low, but sufficient to cater to the subsistence
                  requirements of the indigenous population. Demands on the
                  fertility of the soil were not great because the bush fallow
                  system allowed recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the hoe as the only implement for cultivation, and the
                  practise of mixed planting, soil losses were minimised.

                    We may assume, therefore, that as communities of men changed
                    their methods of land use from herding, to an increasing
                    dependence on hoe cultivation, they acquired substantial
                    knowledge of the soils they used as a means of recognising
                    and distinguishing them ...

                    The shifting cultivator knew and understood his environment.
                    He could assess the fertility of a piece of land and its
                    suitability for one or other of his crops by the vegetation
                    which covered it and the physical characteristics of the
                    soil, and he knew how long he could cultivate each variant
                    and the period required for restoration of fertility (W.
                    Allen)

                  The above passage refutes the belief, held by many, that
                  pre-colonial agricultural practices were static, and as such,

                  Agriculture was communal: the extended family was the main
                  unit of production, and kinsmen were often called in to aid in
                  the tasks of weeding, reaping, threshing and the breaking of
                  new land. The older men usually supervised the work which was
                  carried out primarily by the women and younger men.

                  carried out most of the work of cultivation; while the tasks
                  of preparing the land, herding the cattle, making decisions
                  relating to cropping times, the planting of new lands and
                  abandoning relating to cropping times, the planting of new
                  lands and abandoning of old, were the preserve of males.

                  Prior to the arrival of the whites, the Shona lived on the
                  high and middleveld in the north-east of the country. Crop
                  production was central to the Shona economy and the principal
                  crop cultivated was rapoko, which, due to its hardy,
                  drought-resistant nature, was best suited to the sandy soils
                  in this region.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main difficulty experienced was that of storage: grain
                  could not be stored for long periods, and with no markets,
                  storage of grain was not a viable proposition. To store grain
                  in expectation of a dry period would result in the seed going
                  bad if the drought was not forthcoming. If additional crops
                  were cultivated each year in a similar expectation, they would
                  go to waste as extra grain supplies were not required in good
                  years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In most cases, retention of grain from one season to another
                  was not possible anyway, owing to the vagaries of climate and
                  the prevalence of insect pests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The inherent fragility of the Shona economy, made cattle play
                  an important role. Cattle lived longer, and were not subject
                  to the vagaries of nature to the degree that crops were. In
                  addition, they served important ritual and social purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was these social roles designated to cattle which compelled
                  the Shona to increase their herds; they were only used as an
                  insurance against drought in cases of absolute necessity.

                  After the uprisings - reserves were assigned throughout the
                  country. This was partly owing to an awareness on the part of
                  the BSA Company that the mineral wealth of the country was not
                  as vast as was originally anticipated, and that land was a
                  viable alternative source of wealth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The British government viewed the creation of "<em
                    >native reserves</em
                  >" as a temporary expedient which would disappear once
                  Africans became wage laborers and were incorporated into the
                  exchange economy. They did not envisage the eviction of
                  Africans from white owned land once white agriculture had
                  become firmly entrenched.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reserves were allocated in a haphazard fashion by Native
                  Commissioners (NC) who had no criteria upon which to base
                  their selection of land. By 1900, 15,800,000 acres had already
                  been alienated to whites.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, the land selected for African occupation was, in
                  most cases, of inferior quality. Native reserves were often
                  poor, sandy, low lying and arid, located in districts remote
                  from main roads and railways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They were essentially an afterthought. The settlers had
                  already taken the best land for mining and speculative
                  purposes. The role of the Native Affairs Department in these
                  years was primarily one of administering justice, collecting
                  taxes and inducing Africans to seek work in the mining areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The imposition of the hut tax, and even its doubling in 1904,
                  was not sufficient incentive to induce the indigenous
                  population to seek employment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In these early years, Africans had little incentive to seek
                  work on the mines because they were usually able to meet their
                  financial obligations through the sale of agricultural
                  surplus. The land policy prior to 1908 was not intended to
                  curtail African responses to the agricultural demands of the
                  mining sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were numerous obstacles militating against the expansion
                  of white agriculture prior to 1908, and these explain the lack
                  of interference with African agricultural practices in these
                  years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was gold which initially attracted the settlers, offering a
                  quick and lucrative return. Some viewed the land they had been
                  given as a speculative asset, but very few were aware of its
                  agricultural potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, the transport network was still inefficient in
                  these years, and the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War in 1899
                  worsened the situation by bringing about the suspension of all
                  traffic from the south.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This increased the dependency on African agricultural
                  production when the severing of the rail link with the south
                  caused a cessation in the importation of food supplies by some
                  of the larger companies.

                  <p>
                    Owing to the interruption of railway communication with the
                    south, and the high price of grain occasioned by the war,
                    the natives have been able to trade their grain at a
                    considerable profit (CNC for Matabeleland, 1901)

                  The extent of settlement at this stage did not offer
                  sufficient market opportunities for capital-intensive farming
                  on a profitable scale, and the settlers lacked sufficient
                  capital to inaugurate an efficient agricultural base for the
                  economy.
                </p>
                <p>A settler in the 1890s was quoted as saying</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In those days no farmer grew grain, it being cheaper to
                    trade the country's requirements from the natives
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Any farming that was undertaken was done so in the same manner
                  as that practised by Africans: hoe cultivation, the
                  broadcasting of seeds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Africans responded readily to the demands placed upon them
                  by the white mining sector. As yet, they were unaffected by
                  land policy, and many of them remained on unoccupied white
                  farms, no effort being made to evict them or push them into
                  reserves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While there was still little pressure on the land, Africans
                  were able to increase their acreages in order to produce a
                  surplus for sale to whites.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is evident in the annual reports of several NCs of the
                  time
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>

                <p>
                  Many Africans actually migrated to areas in the vicinity of

                    nearer to the mines so as to be nearer those markets for the
                    more advantageous sale of produce.

                  Prior to the arrival of the whites the principal crop
                  cultivated by Africans had been <em>rapoko</em>. Soon after
                  white settlement, however, the acreage of maize expanded at
                  the expense of rapoko in order to meet the requirements of the
                  mines.

                    large scale with the purpose of trading it to the white man

                <p>
                  Not only were acreages of maize increased, but Africans soon
                  began to cultivate the variety introduced by the whites. In
                  this connection, the NC for the Range commented
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Until 1907 the white population depended on African produced
                    staples. The grain produced increased in response to this
                    demand... Africans grew a variety of maize with small flinty
                    cobs in 1890. For this plant they soon substituted a variety
                    introduced by Europeans with larger cobs. By 1909 the local
                    variety had almost given way in the Mutare district. With
                    the new variety came the expansion of maize cultivation at
                    the expense of finger millet (Wolf Roder, pp. 84/85)
                  </p>

                <p>
                  The opening of trading-stores in the reserves was partly
                  responsible for the migration of some Africans to areas in the
                  vicinity of the mines. They were aware that in selling their
                  grain to traders they did not achieve such high returns. Much
                  of the profit from such sales accrued to middlemen and not to
                  the producers themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many did make use of these trading stores, however, requiring
                  only sufficient capital to meet their limited needs - mainly
                  the payment of taxes. Contact with whites had not, as yet,
                  created larger wants amongst the African population.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The very existence of trading-stores, however, had the effect
                  of creating new wants and needs among Africans, bringing them
                  into contact with goods which the exchange economy was able to
                  provide. In order to acquire such goods, they required a
                  larger amount of capital, and the NC for Murehwa was of the
                  opinion that this would have the effect of forcing more
                  Africans into the labor market.
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                    The opening of trading stations of which there were three in
                    this district last year, has had the effect of making the
                    natives in proximity to these stations plant much bigger
                    lands than usual, and most of these stations do a big cash
                    business.

                  <p>
                    They have a good effect on the labor question, as whenever
                    you create a want, the native must have money to satisfy
                    it... most of the grain traded here finds its market in
                    Salisbury as there are no mines in the district to supply
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The following year the same NC stated</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The purchase of grain by the traders for cash (from the
                    Africans) ought to be restricted, as it will have a very bad
                    effect on the supply of labor.

                <p>
                  In later years, many traders refused to pay Africans cash in
                  exchange for their produce, but did so in goods. This acted as
                  a device to force Africans onto the labor market: for once the
                  desire for additional goods had been awakened in Africans.
                  They required capital in order both to satisfy these and meet
                  their tax obligations.

                <p>
                  In 1903, African sales of grain and livestock amounted to
                  Â£350,000, and in the same year, wage earnings amounted to
                  Â£100,000 - Â£150,000. In other words, agricultural sales
                  totalled 70 percent of all cash earnings.

                  In 1902 thirteen percent of the Shona worked for three months,
                  compared to 48 percent of the Ndebele. The Shona lived on the
                  middle and highveld in Mashona1and, the majority of mines
                  being located in this area. They therefore had easy access to
                  the main white markets and the railway.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their population was small and scattered, hence there was no
                  pressure on the land. Furthermore, they were aided by the
                  opening-up of many small mines in Mashonaland, which resulted
                  in an increased demand for both beer and foodstuffs for the
                  mine workers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona were able to take advantage of these opportunities,
                  whilst the Ndebele were forced onto the labor market at a much
                  earlier date than were the former.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to supplying maize, which soon became the staple
                  diet of the African mine employees, the Shona also responded
                  by increasing the variety of foodstuffs offered for sale:
                  market vegetables were grown as demand arose, especially after
                  1907 when the new dietary regulations for the mines were
                  passed.

                <p>
                  An increasing number of cattle became available for sale,
                  their numbers having increased after the 1895 rinderpest
                  epidemic. The number of African owned cattle increased from
                  63,564 in 1903 to 204,000 in 1908.

                  Cattle sales serve as an important indicator of the
                  receptiveness of Africans to the new economy: in the past
                  Africans were seldom willing to part with their cattle, their
                  symbolic and ritual value holding more importance than their
                  potential economic value; yet on demand from the mining
                  centers they were willing to sell their animals.
