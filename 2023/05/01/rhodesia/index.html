                  The Rhodesian way of life has been eulogised, criticised or
                  lambasted (depending on the standpoint of the writer) from
                  every point of the analytical compass.

                  The strengths and weaknesses of the hard-line White
                  supremacists, the middle-of-the-road men, the liberals and the
                  Nationalists have been probed on countless occasions by
                  writers more eminent, more knowledgeable and more intimately
                  connected with events than I.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And yet, I have a tale to tell. It has not been told in full,
                  and I suggest that this itself makes it of interest. But the
                  details of the story are less important than what I hope they
                  will show, which is how a police state could be conceived,
                  born and nursed into full being by a community of ordinary
                  people ‚Äî "People like us."

                  There is no bigger fool in the world today than a White
                  Rhodesian. For a quarter of my lifetime to date, I was one of
                  them, so I write not from a sense of superiority but from one
                  of involvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was there, I saw it all happening, and yet I and thousands
                  like me did little or nothing, certainly by no means enough,
                  to stop it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We saw, but did not believe. We could not understand that, in
                  the name of preserving their precious Rhodesian Way of Life,
                  White Rhodesians themselves would systematically set about
                  destroying the very basis upon which it was founded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only two days after our arrival, we acquired our first African
                  servant ‚Äî houseboy, as we quickly learned to call him. He was
                  a smoothly good-looking man of about 30 who, to our relief,
                  spoke excellent English and knew his job well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We were slightly in awe of him ‚Äî he was very superior and our
                  previous experience of servants extended as far as employing
                  the infrequent char ‚Äî and he had two habits which we found
                  strange.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first was to spend hours every evening catching and eating
                  ‚Äî live ‚Äî the great, green, locust-like grasshoppers which
                  swarmed around the street-light outside our garden.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second was pilfering, which was simple enough from an
                  inexperienced couple such as us, but we learned fast enough to
                  part company with David, for that was what he called himself,
                  after a month.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whether David had a wife or family, I never knew. I didn't
                  ask. He lived in the "<em>kia</em>", as the servants quarters
                  are known throughout Southern Africa. It simply means "room".
                  David's was better than most, as we were to learn through the
                  years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It consisted of an unplastered brick room built on to the
                  garage, seven feet by seven feet by seven feet, furnished by a
                  bed with the bare minimum of steel springing and a mattress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He brought his own blankets, cooked his own food on a primus
                  stove provided by us (he was permitted to cook our food in our
                  kitchen on our electric stove, but not his own) and had what
                  were euphemistically known as ‚Äúseparate toilet facilities.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p>
                  This meant a cold water ‚Äúshower‚Äù in a 2ft. by 2ft. box which
                  also had a hole in the floor. Many Africans, we were told by
                  those we felt should know, were not civilised enough to use a
                  lavatory with a scat. They preferred to squat ...
                </p>
                <p>
                  One such authority was the genial giant who was another
                  neighbor. Like David, he also frightened us timid newcomers,
                  although in a different way. David had been with us a couple
                  of hours, and we were revelling in the "luxury" of being
                  waited on for the first time, when a cheerful hail took me
                  across to his fence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our new friend was well over six feet tall and burly with it.
                  He wore khaki shorts to just above mid-thigh, and a
                  short-sleeved shirt with pockets on the breast. Muscular
                  tanned thighs and biceps bulged (he had played rugby for the
                  Transvaal, I believe) and he addressed me in the guttural
                  Afrikaans accent which it is impossible to reproduce in print.
                </p>
                <p>He introduced himself.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Just out from the old country, eh?<br />
                    <strong><em>Yes.</em></strong
                    ><br />
                    Been in Africa before?<br />
                    <strong><em>Not really, Egypt, for a bit ...</em></strong>
                    <br />
                    Ah. So you don't know about Africans, then?<br />
                    <strong><em>What do you mean? </em></strong><br />
                    See you've got a boy then.<br />
                    <strong
                      ><em>Yes, we've got three sons, actually.</em></strong
                    >
                    <br />
                    No, house boy. But don't you worry. You have any trouble
                    with him, just bring him to me. I'm in the African Education
                    Department and I can hit them so the police don't see. Come
                    and have a snifter.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  It would not be true to pretend that the conversation made a
                  stronger impression on me than to leave a vague unease. For
                  the Parker family, as for the thousands of other immigrants,
                  the last thing to worry about was the African in Rhodesia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He was there, convenient, irritating, smiling, insolent,
                  hardworking or shiftless, however one found him. But he wasn't
                  our concern. We had no reforming zeal to improve his lot, no
                  wish or need to meet. In fact, it was more than seven years
                  before we entertained an African family in our own home for
                  the first (and last) time. It is not a record we are proud of,
                  nor for that matter particularly ashamed of.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond a mild resolve to treat our servants well and, within
                  reason, generously ‚Äî which like many good resolutions we often
                  failed to fulfil ‚Äî we had no feelings at all. In those first
                  tentative years in Bulawayo, Lobengula's former capital, we
                  made the groping beginnings to try to meet and know and to
                  understand the extraordinary society which had accepted us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Very broadly speaking, this fell into three categories. There
                  were Pre-War Rhodesians (White); Post-War or New Rhodesians
                  (White) and Kaffirs (Black).
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was also the twilight fringe of what is called in
                  Rhodesia the Coloured Community (the unhappy products of
                  miscegenation) and those members of the Moslem fraternity and
                  their descendants from Pakistan and India who were always
                  referred to as "Eyeshuns."

                  In the category of Pre-War Rhodesians must be included of
                  course their offspring. By and large they made up the
                  Establishment from which were drawn the governments of the
                  Federation and its three territories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the top of the Rhodesian social ladder came the Pioneers
                  (Capital P). These were the gentlemen (and occasional lady)
                  who had been members of the 1890 Column which first colonised
                  the territory or possibly had arrived earlier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early Settlers (Capital E S) arrived between 1893 and 1896.
                  And third down the ladder were early settlers (lower case es)
                  who had been so fortunate as to arrive before the turn of the
                  century. In the nature of things some 65 years later there
                  were only a few of these venerable figures left.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course it is unfair to generalise, but in the main Pre-War
                  Rhodesians tended to be rich, farmers or traders, have
                  undistinguished offspring whom they sent (if male) to Plumtree
                  or St. George's, the Rhodesian Eton and Harrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Occasionally they turned out to be poor, feckless and living
                  and dying in squalor in one of the corrugated iron-roofed
                  shanties in the older roads, their minds sapped by the sun,
                  their money sunk in cheap Cape brandy, and their habitations
                  eaten away by white ants.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Post-War Rhodesians were beginning to make their weight
                  felt in society. This was the time when immigration reached
                  its peak of 20,000 a year for a short period, and although the
                  bulk of us came either from Britain or South Africa, there was
                  a substantial infusion of Greeks, Italians, Germans and
                  Scandinavians.

                    Due to the large amount of leisure and recreational time,
                    combined with much higher paying jobs than the majority of
                    the population, alcohol played a large part in the Rhodesian
                    way of life. The sports clubs all had bars, many homes had
                    their owns bars and most social activities revolved around
                    alcohol.

                  Rhodesia, tucked away behind its barriers of time and distance
                  for so long, was brimming over with activity. The mood was
                  expansion. Capital and people were flooding in, bringing with
                  them new outlooks and novel ideas. For ten years Salisbury,
                  once described to me by a Rhodesian as ‚Äúthe town where the
                  prevailing disease is an ingrowing mind‚Äù became the
                  cosmopolitan capital of Africa south of the Sahara.

                  It is strange now to recall how real it all was, when so much
                  of it has turned out to be illusion.

                  <strong>MORE BRITISH THAN THE BRITISH</strong><br />
                  All communities are to some extent bound by their past; after
                  all, the present is founded on it. White Rhodesians, Old and
                  New, are swathed to the eyebrows with their history, perhaps
                  because there is not much of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1967, two years after UDI, a television executive in
                  Rhodesia who had left in disgust to live in London received a
                  letter from his former boss in Salisbury. It offered him a job
                  better than his old one, at vastly enhanced salary, and went
                  on:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    What we are trying to do here now is to re-create the
                    Rhodesia of the 1920s and '30s. I am sure we will succeed,
                    and I am sure you are the man to help us do so.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Apart from the attitude of facing what is to come with your
                  eyes firmly fixed on what may have happened forty years ago,
                  the remarkable thing about this letter is that it was written
                  by a man who himself became a Rhodesian only in 1960!
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is no reason to doubt his sincerity. But the fact
                  remains that in 1970, three years after writing the letter,
                  its author himself was back in London, looking for a job.
                  Perhaps he found the task of re-creating the past beyond him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The point about Rhodesia and its past is that, since the day
                  that Cecil Rhodes's emissaries persuaded Lobengula to
                  sign the Rudd Concession, permitting the white man to mine for
                  gold and other minerals, Rhodesia has been living a lie.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The white man originally took control of the country by a
                  trick, and ever since then has indulged in any number of
                  historical self-deceptions designed to perpetuate the
                  supremacy of white over black, the myth by which Rhodesia has
                  lived since 1890.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Any white Rhodesian will tell you that the African has
                  contributed nothing to the advancement of himself, or the
                  world, through the centuries. Before the white man came to
                  Rhodesia, you can be sure, Matabele were slaughtering Mashona
                  by the thousand, and the white man's only purpose was to
                  pacify the country so that he could mine it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To hear the Rhodesian tell it, the Mashona people were on the
                  verge of being eliminated by the ‚Äúmurdering Matabele hordes‚Äù
                  when the just and generous white man took over and brought
                  peace to a troubled land.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before the white man came to Rhodesia the country was mainly
                  populated by two tribes. The larger and longer-established
                  were the Mashona, who occupied the land for centuries and
                  whose ancestors built the medieval fortress near Fort Victoria
                  now known as Zimbabwe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is now generally accepted that these fascinating ruins form
                  concrete evidence that hundreds of years ago the Africans of
                  the center of the continent organised and ran their own
                  complex civilisation. The golden empire of Mwene Mutapa may
                  well have been the source of the untold riches of the Queen of
                  Sheba.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whatever the glories of their past, the Mashona in the late
                  nineteenth century had fallen upon hard times. They were
                  totally dominated by their less numerous but much tougher
                  neighbors, the Matabele. These warriors, offshoots of the Zulu
                  nation, swept north in the first half of the century.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their chief, Mzilikazi, had incurred the disfavor of Shaka,
                  the great king who had knit the disjointed Bantu tribes of
                  South Africa into a national unit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After brushing with the Boers, at the time themselves occupied
                  with their ‚Äútreks‚Äù north from the Cape, Mzilikazi settled with
                  his warriors in what is now known as Matabeleland, and, true
                  to his custom, proceeded to subjugate his neighbors the
                  Mashona, a mild and inoffensive people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their villages were subject to periodic raiding by Matabele
                  impis, their women and their cattle were carried off and their
                  young men killed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Horrific as this practice sounds, there is no evidence
                  whatsoever that the Mashona were being subjected to systematic
                  genocide, as the modern white Rhodesian would have you
                  believe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is more evidence to suggest that the Mashona were
                  prepared to submit to the occasional raids by the forces of a
                  dominant chief like Lobengula than they were the subtle and
                  insidious presence of the white man, who came upon their land
                  by stealth and then, before they realised what had happened,
                  assumed control and suppressed opposition by force.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Occupation of Rhodesia has been fully documented elsewhere
                  many times, but it is necessary at least to sketch in the
                  outlines of what Rhodesians regard as their propitious
                  beginnings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nineteenth-century Africa was dominated by the discovery of
                  diamonds at Kimberley and gold on the Rand in Transvaal. These
                  in turn were themselves dominated by Cecil John Rhodes, the
                  son of an English country parson and the least likely of all
                  men to achieve greatness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the age of 17 he went to Africa for the sake of his health.
                  He had weak lungs, and indeed these were to kill him before he
                  reached fifty. But the sickly boy outmaneuvered the Victorian
                  moguls and the adventurers who flocked from all over the world
                  to share in the new wealth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He amassed a tremendous fortune himself, became Prime Minister
                  of the Cape Colony, and founded the Chartered Company to
                  further his dream of spreading the British flag north to the
                  Mediterranean.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The history of Rhodes's machinations to obtain the Rudd
                  Concession from the Matabele King Lobengula makes sad reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Robert Moffatt, a Scottish missionary, had won the friendship
                  and confidence of Mzilikazi, Lobengula's father, and Rhodes
                  with cool calculation sent Moffatt's son John, following in
                  his father's evangelistic footsteps, to the court of Lobengula
                  to trade on his father's trust.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was not quite like shooting a sitting rabbit, for
                  Lobengula, primitive and uneducated though he was, was a
                  crafty ruler who foresaw pretty clearly the menace of the
                  white man's advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moffatt persuaded Lobengula to repudiate a tentative agreement
                  he had signed previously with the Boers of the Transvaal, and
                  to put his thumb-print instead on a mutual protection treaty
                  with the British.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The subsequent protection that the invading British columns
                  received from Lobengula was considerable. In return, Lobengula
                  was first tricked into allowing the white columns within his
                  territory, next his brave young men were slaughtered by the
                  Maxim gun, and finally his capital was surrounded and he
                  himself forced to flee into the bush to die.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rhodes's ‚Äúprotection‚Äù would seem to have served as an
                  excellent model for the latter-day excesses of the mafiosa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the missionaries, Rhodes sent in the businessmen. With
                  Moffatt and another missionary, C.D. Helm (also paid by
                  Rhodes) advising him and certifying his character, Rhodes's
                  agent C.D. Rudd, obtained the famous piece of paper which
                  assigned him ‚Äúand his heirs and successors‚Äù the right to mine
                  for metals and minerals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rhodesians have always been conscious that the pen, indeed,
                  can be mightier than the sword. Rhodes promptly persuaded the
                  British Government that Rudd's document was his charter to
                  occupy Lobengula's empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Britain's policy at the time was Imperialistic and she had no
                  intention of being left behind when it came to sharing the
                  spoils of the great African carve-up. Rhodes got his backing,
                  and the Chartered Company was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was of course the promise of Mashonaland's gold which
                  attracted investors to the Company. And it was a precisely
                  similar promise which Rhodes held out to the 700 motley
                  individuals he recruited to form the Pioneer Column which
                  finally settled on the site of what is now Salisbury in 1890.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is perhaps significant that Rhodesia's road has been
                  littered with broken promises of one sort or another since the
                  very beginning. Lobengula thought he was signing way the right
                  of a few men to dig holes in the ground; the Pioneers believed
                  they were destined to make fortunes in return for a slightly
                  risky few months' ride.

                  The Chartered Company's investors were led to believe their
                  millions would reap billions and burnish the lustre of the
                  British Crown. Lobengula lost his warriors, his cattle, his
                  kingdom and his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Pioneers made hardly a golden sovereign to rub between
                  them; it was not until modern machinery and methods could be
                  imported years later that anyone earned more than a few
                  shillings out of Rhodesia's gold, and then most of it was
                  found under the ancient workings of the despised Africans.

                <p>
                  Rhodes's Company failed to pay a dividend for over thirty
                  years, which must have pleased the investors no end; and far
                  from bringing honor to the British Crown the Rhodesian
                  adventure culminated seventy-odd years later in messy and
                  idiotic rebellion.

                  Occupation Day is a solemn occasion in white Rhodesia ‚Äî a day
                  of martial music, flagpole ceremonies and special prayers
                  under the jacaranda trees of Salisbury's Cecil Square.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the Pioneers who drove the first Column through
                  Lobengula's kingdom to make laager under the lee of Harare
                  Kopje are the recipients of a kind of reverence they neither
                  deserved or would have expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Column consisted of 200 volunteers recruited in South
                  Africa from more than 2,000 applicants tempted by the offer of
                  3,000 acres of land and 15 free mining claims apiece. With
                  them went an ‚Äúescort‚Äù of 500 ‚Äúpolice‚Äù, who would today be
                  described as mercenaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Organised under regular military officers and on military
                  lines, the Escort contained as extraordinary a mixture of
                  adventurers as ever got together under a pirate's flag.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, the whole expedition had something of the piratical
                  about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Looking back now, perhaps the most surprising of all their
                  achievements was that they stayed long enough to establish the
                  community that Rhodes was banking on as his outpost of Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That they arrived at all was largely due to the forbearance of
                  Lobengula, who stubbornly resisted the wishes of his impis to
                  attack the white man.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So as not to provoke an open confrontation with the warriors
                  who had faced and beaten British troops only a few years
                  before in open battle, the Column skirted Lobengula's
                  strongholds in Matabeleland and, led by the white hunter
                  Selous, headed for the high veld of Mashonaland.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was no resistance from the Mashona, already cowed into
                  subservience by the Matabele raiders, and indeed it seems
                  likely that some of the Mashona tribe at first welcomed the
                  white man's guns as protection against the long spears of the
                  Matabele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once he was in, however, the white man proved impossible to
                  dislodge. Settlements were quickly established as the miners
                  spread themselves around, looking for gold, and the farmers
                  began carving a livelihood out of the fertile bush.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Quickly the Mashona found themselves the unknowing victims of
                  the white man's cash economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Oversimplified, it went like this. The white man wanted (and
                  needed) the African's labour in order to dig his mine or work
                  his land. But the African, accustomed to centuries of
                  subsistence farming, had no desire (or need) to work for a
                  living.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Without putting too fine a point on it, if the white man was
                  not to press the black into direct slavery, which would have
                  been hardly possible or politic even in the 1890s, then he had
                  to create in the black both the desire and the need for money.

                  The white man's luxuries, his guns, his liquor, his way of
                  life, could only be purchased for hard cash. The Mashona had
                  nothing to sell except their labor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But there was something else, too. The Charter granted by the
                  British Government authorised the Company to set up an
                  administration to run the new territories. The Administration
                  needed cash on which to run itself, so it promptly imposed
                  taxes on all those living in the area over which it claimed
                  authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not very much indeed ‚Äî just a few shillings a head each year ‚Äî
                  but so the African was forced into the white man's employ in
                  order to pay the white man's tax. So the cycle was complete,
                  and in all basic principles has remained so ever since.

                  One of the proudest boasts of White Rhodesia is that, until
                  the riots in Salisbury and Bulawayo in 1960, not a single life
                  had been taken by the internal security forces. The lessons
                  meted out in response to the Matebele and Mashona ‚Äúrebellions‚Äù
                  in 1893 and 1896 were strong ones indeed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It suits modern Rhodesians to refer to both events as
                  ‚Äúrebellions‚Äù. In fact, the 1893 affair was the inevitable
                  ultimate clash between Lobengula and the white intruders that
                  he had postponed by his forbearance three years before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In spite of the establishment of the white communities of
                  Salisbury, Fort Victoria and other places, Lobengula still
                  claimed for his impis the right to raid the Mashona.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This they did, by and large leaving the whites alone.
                  Mashonaland's first Administrator, Dr Jameson, believed firmly
                  that the white man would never be secure in Rhodesia until
                  Lobengula's power was broken and the Company's rule extended
                  to cover Matebeleland as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He had no compunction at using the periodic Matabele raids to
                  force a showdown with Lobengula and using his light artillery
                  and the Maxim gun to mow down the impis at long range.

                    Accustomed to hunting the Mashona like rabbits, the Matabele
                    imagined that they were all powerful. In vain they were told
                    that they could not win this war.
                  </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  Many of the Matabele had never faced gunfire before and some
                  of them showed fanatical bravery in the face of devastating
                  firepower. Lobengula burned down his headquarters and fled,
                  having first with remarkable tolerance ensured the safety of
                  the white traders who had been trapped with him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lobengula was reputed to have taken with him in his flight the
                  bulk of his treasure and it appears to have been this fact,
                  rather than any pressing military necessity, that tempted
                  Major Allan Wilson and his Patrol of 33 men to venture after
                  them into the thick bush near the Shangani River.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They died to a man, and it was their fate which has inspired
                  the most lasting and remarkable Rhodesian legend of all. Their
                  remains lie under the wide skies at World's View, in the
                  Matopos Hills, not thirty yards from the bones of Cecil Rhodes
                  himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is not too far from the truth to suggest that in white
                  Rhodesia's hierarchy of religious idols, God comes 35th,
                  although not one Rhodesian in a thousand could repeat the name
                  of a single member of the Patrol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Matebele were defeated with very heavy losses. Some
                  reports put the number at 5,000 tribesmen slain. What is
                  certain is that, apart from Major Wilson's ill-fated Patrol,
                  white losses were extremely small.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was far from the case in the totally unexpected Mashona
                  uprising which followed some three years later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was largely inspired by the Mlimo priests, whose
                  influence had grown sharply since the defeat of the Matabele.
                  It was the first example of Rhodesia's Africans combining in a
                  genuine national movement to try to be rid of the white man's
                  yoke, and the lessons learned then have weighed heavily on
                  Rhodesia's history ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the first place, the uprising was far less gentlemanly from
                  the white man's point of view. This time there was no casual
                  massacre of the valiant savage at long range from behind the
                  comfortable sights of a Maxim gun.
                </p>

                  Death came in the night, by the knife and the panga, to women
                  and children as well as men, and more than one-tenth of the
                  4,000 Europeans then in the Colony died in the first month or
                  two of the fighting.

                <p>
                  The "rebellion" caught the whites at precisely the wrong time.
                  Dr Jameson had denuded Rhodesia of both men and horses to take
                  part in the ill-fated Jameson Raid on the Rand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Militarily, the result in retrospect was never in doubt. The
                  white men grouped themselves for the last time into their
                  famous Boer-type laagers in Salisbury and Bulawayo and other
                  white centres, and waited for help from the South in the form
                  of Imperial troops. This was readily forthcoming, but it took
                  more than 18 months before Rhodesia was pacified.

                <p>
                  This was the last time for many years that Rhodesia made World
                  (or even British) headlines. After the first turbulent decade,
                  the country settled down at the dawn of the new century to
                  some fifty years of steady, if unspectacular development.

                  The white assumption of supremacy had immigrated with the

                  To the white man, the defeat of the tribes had given added

                  atrocities committed by both sides in the fighting were never

                  <strong>THE MATIMBA STORY</strong><br />
                  At a dance near London, Patrick Matimba met and fell in love
                  with a young blonde housemaid from Holland. A short time later
                  the two married. After returning home, he became the center of
                  the most widely publicized racial dispute in all of Southern
                  Rhodesia's history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The government found no legal way to keep Mrs Matimba out of
                  the country. The Land Apportionment Act of 1941 forbade whites
                  and blacks to live in the same community. At first, Patrick
                  offered to become his own wife's servant ‚Äîthe only kind of
                  African permitted to live among Europeans.

                <p>
                  Then Saint Faith's Anglican Mission, in the white
                  tobacco-growing settlement of Rusape, where his father had
                  worked, gave Patrick a job as a ¬£12-a-month storekeeper, and
                  two rooms where he and his family could live. It seemed a
                  satisfactory solution‚Äîuntil the whites of Rusape, many of whom
                  migrated from South Africa, were heard from.

                  A tailor refused to accept her husband's trousers for dry
                  cleaning. When Patrick entered a bank without removing his
                  hat, a teller ordered him out for failing to show the proper
                  respect for white depositors.

                  As Rusape citizens hammered away at the government to exile

                  moved the second reading of an extraordinary amendment to the
                  Land Apportionment Act, proposing that any European woman who

                  <strong>RHODESIAN PSYCHOSIS AND THE IMPACT OF WAR</strong
                  ><br />
                  It was perhaps inevitable that during the 1970s some Rhodesian
                  men and women would be affected by the very considerable
                  psychological pressures in their daily lives - the guerrilla
                  war and the ever-present danger of a sudden ambush or landmine
                  detonation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Symptoms of this Rhodesian psychosis manifested itself in many
                  ways - long before post-traumatic stress disorder had ever
                  been heard of.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was moral injury, a term used in the mental-health
                  community to describe the psychological damage that service
                  members face when they are confronted with war in their lives;
                  many Rhodesians suffered from this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the outward display of morale was high, the inner
                  psyche for many was troubled indeed. In the aftermath of the
                  Rhodesian civil war, few spoke of their experiences other than
                  in terms of self-justification or, as some have expressed it,
                  as the best time of their life.

                  The 1970s witnessed an unprecedented increase in the divorce
                  rate, rising levels of illegitimate pregnancies, births and
                  abortions, suicides and rising drug and alcohol abuse among
                  whites. Social welfare workers diagnosed the root cause as
                  being the pressures on white society under siege.

                <p>
                  A key contributor to this malaise was the extended periods of
                  call-ups and bush duty and the resultant strain on the fabric
                  of family life. By the late 1970s, virtually every able-bodied
                  man and women was engaged in the "war effort", which was
                  eroding the fabric of their society, and decent Christian
                  values were no longer quite so important as before.

                  A steady decline in moral behavior was noticeable after
                  December 1972 at the Centenary police camp in north-eastern
                  Rhodesia. In the space of a few months, this sleepy backwater
                  police station, set in the heartland of the Centenary tobacco
                  farming area, had been turned into a military camp where the
                  inspector in charge exercised little control.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Special Branch representative at Centenary was noted for
                  his ability to provide a steady supply of prohibited "girlie"
                  magazines (Playboy, Penthouse, Fiesta and Hustler) to his
                  senior colleagues. It was a common procedure that most Special
                  Branch or CIO officers traveling outside Rhodesia would be
                  "facilitated" upon their return - meaning that they passed
                  unhindered through Customs and Immigration formalities at the
                  airport. Many officers used this privilege to smuggle in
                  pornography, alcohol and other goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Daily meetings served as a venue for the exchange of anonymous
                  brown manila envelopes marked "On Government Service". These
                  envelopes contained both soft and hard-core pornographic
                  magazines, which were discreetly referred to as training
                  manuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Naturally, the habit of sharing pornographic magazines spread
                  quickly to the lower ranks. The main reason for controlling
                  the influx of pornographic material was one of "protecting
                  Christian values", but there was also a racial dimension, and
                  in the late 1960s Playboy magazine was banned chiefly because
                  of fears that blacks would see them.

                  At Centenary and later at Bindura, the senior officers º mess
                  regularly hosted parties known as "grimmies" (as grim looks
                  did not matter if they could provide casual sex). Inevitably,
                  the practice filtered down into the lower ranks, who made
                  their own arrangements. Many of the women who appeared at
                  these "parties" were wives of neighboring farmers, whose
                  husbands were on call-up, or women who motored up from
                  Salisbury.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even when they were not on call-up duty, men attended Friday
                  night security-briefing sessions, which became known as prayer
                  meetings. "Prayers" became a convenient excuse to get away
                  from home for a good "piss-up" and periodic strip shows. Many
                  concerned wives wrote to army headquarters complaining about
                  these "prayer meetings", and some distraught mothers and wives
                  wrote complaining letters to the newspapers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the duration of the call-up time steadily lengthened, some
                  husbands cheated on their wives by falsely claiming to be on
                  military service when they were with their girlfriends or
                  mistresses. However, in the absence of their menfolk, some
                  women openly cuckolded their husbands by seeking male
                  companionship in the same manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One-night stands became a regular habit, and a favorite
                  meeting place was the Reps Theatre bar in the Avondale suburb
                  of Harare.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At many nightclubs, "ladies night" thrived as women banded
                  together after work and thrilled to the acrobatics of male
                  strippers, who would entertain until 8.00 p.m.
