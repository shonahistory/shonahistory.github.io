                <p>
                  I shall concentrate on the main stone-games to be seen in the
                  villages: <em>tsoro</em> (also called <em>fuva</em> and
                  <em>imbwe</em>), <em>tsoro yemutwelve</em>, <em></em> and
                  <em>nhodo</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>NHODO</strong><br />
                  The game demanding least thought of these four is
                  <em>nhodo</em> (also known as <em>noda</em> or
                  <em>kudoda</em>), although it does demand some manual
                  dexterity. The game is normally played by girls, but boys
                  sometimes play. Those playing collect a pile of small stones
                  (<em>matombo</em>), and scoop a semi-circular hole about six
                  inches in diameter in the ground. The only other thing
                  required is the <em>nhodo</em> itself, a large stone or small
                  tree-fruit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first participant (to be referred to as A) puts some of
                  the stones into the hole to begin. The remainder are kept to
                  one side as a reserve. She throws up the nhodo, and while it
                  is in the air, scoops out onto the ground all or some of the
                  stones from the hole. She then catches the nhodo. If she drops
                  it her turn is over.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She throws up the nhodo again, and this time pushes the stones
                  back into the hole, all except one, and catches the nhodo. The
                  hand must be flattened along the ground in order to perform
                  the push most effectively, and considerable dexterity is to be
                  seen among girls playing this game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The one stone not returned to the hole is retained after each
                  successful throw to form the nucleus for future turns. Once
                  the nhodo is dropped, or anything other than the one single
                  stone remains out of the hole, A's turn is over and it is the
                  turn of B on her right.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each competitor on starting must put her accumulated single
                  stones into the hole. When she has used up all the stones in
                  the hole with a succession of successful throws, she draws
                  upon the reserve of small stones to one side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When these are exhausted and she has all the stones before her
                  as singles, if she manages to keep going so long, she turns to
                  the competitor on her right (B) and with a triumphant
                  <em>"Ndakudya!"</em> (I have eaten you) demands that the
                  latter put all her stock of singles into the hole for her to
                  carry on with. B, now having no reserve with which to start,
                  retires from the game, which continues until all the
                  competitors except one have been "eaten".
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>TSORO</strong><br />
                  This is the common game among African men. As it is impossible
                  in a short article of this nature to describe all the possible
                  variations. I will content myself with some of the most usual.
                  The "board" for the game demands four parallel rows of holes
                  (<em>makomba</em>) about three inches in diameter, hollowed in
                  the ground. There can be any number of holes horizontally.
                  Eight is probably the most common, but variations between six
                  and 21 are commonly to be met with. 12, 15 and 18 are quite
                  usual. The men are once again small pebbles
                  (<em>matombo</em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The way in which they are set out in the variation which I
                  shall take as basic (referred to as basic version) is as
                  follows:
                </p>
                <figure class="size-full">
                  <img loading="lazy" src="./A.webp" alt="Diagram A" />
                  <figcaption>Diagram A</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  (a) The game starts when A picks up two stones from any of his
                  holes. The basic principle is that after picking up he drops
                  one stone into each successive hole, and if his last stone
                  drops into a hole which is already occupied, he picks up all
                  the stones in that hole and carries on until his last stone
                  drops into a vacant hole. He moves in an anti-clockwise
                  direction only around his own two horizontal rows, never into
                  his opponent's.<br />
                  (b) If the last stone (falling into a vacant hole) finishes in
                  a hole in the inner row (Row ii for A, Row iii for B) and both
                  holes vertically opposite him are occupied by his opponent's
                  stones, he removes all those stones from the board. He can
                  only take thus, however, if his opponent has a stone
                  vertically opposite in the inner row. Thus if A is playing and
                  his final stone drops into Row ii, hole 3, and B has stones In
                  Row iii, hole 3, and Row iv, hole 3, B will lose all those
                  stones. He cannot lose'his stones from iv, 3, however, if iii,
                  3 is not occupied.<br />
                  (c) The object of the game is to take all one's opponent's
                  stones.<br />
                  (d) Until all his holes are occupied by single stones a player
                  may only commence a move at a hole containing more than one
                  stone.<br />
                  (e) When he reaches the stage where all his occupied holes
                  have not more than one stone in them, he may move any of these
                  single stones, provided that it has an empty hole in front of
                  it to move into. At this final stage a stone may never be
                  moved into an occupied hole.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is the basic game, but in actual fact tsoro is not
                  usually played in such a simplified form. One or more of the
                  following common variations are introduced:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Variant 1</strong><br />
                  Two of the back-row (i and iv) holes are nominated as "heads"
                  (<em>misoro</em>). The ones usually chosen are i, I and 2 for
                  A, and iv, 7 and 8 for B. If a player's final stone drops into
                  one of his <em>misoro</em>, he need not pick up all the stones
                  in it and move on as usual unless he chooses. It is thus
                  possible to accumulate a tactical stock-pile ready for a
                  lightning swoop along the front row at the right moment. There
                  is one other advantage for stones in the <em>misoro</em>. See
                  below (Variant 6).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Variant 2</strong><br />
                  Sometimes only one <em>musoro</em> is nominated. In this
                  variation it is obligatorily hole 8 for A, and hole I for B.
                  Three stones are put in this hole at the beginning instead of
                  only two. The game then continues as before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Variant 3</strong><br />
                  If playing Variant 1, and the two <em>misoro</em> chosen are
                  holes 1 and 8 for both players, it is customary to have three
                  stones at the beginning in No. 8 for A and in No. 1 for B, as
                  in Variant 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Variant 4</strong><br />
                  After taking any of his opponent's stones the player drops
                  them singly into his next holes and continues as before. Here
                  the stones do not leave the board as is normal but are
                  gradually amassed by one player until his opponent has none
                  left. This is a long and complicated game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Variant 5</strong><br />
                  After a take a player is entitled to make "additional takes"
                  of further stones from any one, two, three (four or five), of
                  his opponent's holes, number to be specified before the game
                  starts. Four or five additional takes are normally only found
                  in games such as Tracey's variation. (Variant No. 7 below.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Variant 6</strong><br />
                  If playing a game with <em>misoro</em>, stones in the misoro
                  cannot be removed in any privileged additional takes described
                  above and are therefore in a position of considerable safety,
                  being exposed only to the normal take.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Variant 7</strong><br />
                  The stones are set out as follows:
                </p>

                <figure class="size-full">
                  <img loading="lazy" src="./B.webp" alt="Diagram B" />
                  <figcaption>Diagram B</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  The normal basic rules are followed, but the usual first move
                  is for both players to commence with the same hole (ii, 6 for
                  A and iii, 3 for B). This will enable each player to take four
                  stones from his opponent immediately and then as variant 5 is
                  followed here, stones from five more holes as an additional
                  take following the first take.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the second take stones from three additional holes are
                  acquired, and after the third and each subsequent take, from
                  two more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are many additional variations, some of which only
                  employ two single rows of holes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>NOTES ON THE COURSE OF THE GAME AND ON TACTICS</strong
                  ><br />
                  It will be obvious from what has been said that before
                  beginning a game with a stranger one must agree upon what
                  variation one is to play, as there are so many regional
                  differences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The basic difference between the good player and the poor one
                  lies in how far ahead he can foresee the consequences of his
                  moves. A practised player will not only be able to tell at a
                  glance exactly how far his stones will take him (a matter
                  which can require some calculation by an amateur in a
                  complicated move), but can also forecast the moves which he
                  will thus force his opponent to make.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This ability is especially important in Variants 5, 6 and 7,
                  where such knowledge will tell one which holes to remove
                  stones from in additional takes in order to hamper one's
                  opponent most severely in his future moves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game has an opening, a middle game and an end game like
                  chess (only not so complicated). The opening, especially in
                  games using misoro, is devoted to building up a powerful
                  position. The middle game continues this, but endeavors not to
                  leave the opponent only with singles, for as long as he has
                  one double that is the one he must begin his move with, so
                  that his moves are predictable and his singles may be picked
                  off at leisure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The end-game, when only singles are left, is of vital
                  importance, however, and many a promising game has been lost
                  here as the result of a false move. It is vital to enter the
                  end game in a good position so as to dictate the pace of the
                  final stages of the game. The best possible position is, from
                  the point of view of B, one blocking stone in iii, 8, which
                  will take all A's singles as they finally advance along Row
                  ii, and plenty of singles grouped around the left-hand ends of
                  rows iii and iv which can be moved singly for a long time, so
                  that the blocking stone docs not have to move until A is
                  forced to advance along Row ii.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tsoro is sometimes played with bottle-tops instead of stones
                  on a board marked out in pencil or chalk.

                  <strong>TSORO YEMU TWELVE</strong><br />
                  This is another stone-game, usually played by boys and young
                  men, although adults do play. It is played on a board marked
                  as follows:

                </figure>
                <p>
                  The board is usually scratched in the ground. Each player has
                  twelve stones, but in this game A's stones must be
                  distinguishable from those of B. Different material is the
                  usual way of ensuring this.
                </p>
                <p>The game is played in three stages:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Stage 1</strong> <br />
                  Each player in turn places one of his stones at any
                  intersection of any lines on the board not already occupied by
                  his opponent's stone(s). His object is to form a line of three
                  stones, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Each
                  time a line is completed, the player takes any one of his
                  opponent's stones. When a line has been formed a player may
                  move away one of its component stones on his next go in order
                  subsequently to complete the same line again by moving it
                  back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Stage 2</strong><br />
                  When all of each player's 12 stones have been placed on the
                  board, play consists in moving around the stones on the board,
                  one space at a time along any line, in order to complete rows
                  of three stones as above and thus reduce one's opponent's
                  number of men.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Stage 3</strong><br />
                  As soon as any player is reduced to three stones only, he has
                  the right to move any of those stones directly to any
                  intersection on the board, even though his opponent who has
                  more than three may still be having to move one space at a
                  time. As soon as either player is reduced to two stones he has
                  lost, for he can no longer form lines of three.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is interesting to note that a game played on an identical
                  board is the Chinese game of Dig Dig (“Straight Line”). The
                  rules are essentially the same, but differ in a few
                  particulars from the African game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Notable among these differences is that during Stage I it is
                  possible to cancel out any man of one's opponent by placing
                  one's own man on top of it (the Chinese game uses grass and
                  twigs), and at the end of Stage 1 all cancelled men are
                  removed from the board, and also that there does not seem to
                  be any free moving in Stage 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game is also played in Malaysia. There it seems to be
                  regarded as a kind of poor man's chess, having given rise to
                  the proverb
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Chinese chess is for immortals, straight line for beggars
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  There are also some games played by European children which
                  bear some resemblance to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>TSORO YEMUTATU</strong><br />
                  This, in its various forms, is a very simple form of tsoro
                  yemutwelve. Each side has only three stones, so that the first
                  person to complete a line is the winner. The stones may be
                  moved anywhere, not just one space. The two most commonly used
                  boards are given below.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It will be noticed that in B, since there are seven
                  intersections and six stones on the board, there is only ever
                  one intersection to move into, and what determines whether the
                  player affords his opponent a line is, which stone he moves.
                  There is always a right and a wrong move available, and if
                  both players are skilled, the game can go on for a very long
                  time before either makes a slip.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tsoro yemutwelve and yemutatu are also sometimes played with
                  bottle-tops.
