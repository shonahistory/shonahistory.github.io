                <p>
                  From the 12th to the 19th centuries the southern Zambezia
                  plateau was dominated by the Shona-speaking peoples. Although
                  the Portuguese influenced chiefs in the north during the
                  seventeenth century, they did not destroy the basic Shona
                  economic, social and political structure of the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the beginning of the 19th centuries saw the permanent loss
                  of Shona territory in the south-west and south-east to the
                  Tswana and Tsonga-Hlengwe, as well as the invasions of the
                  <em>mfecane</em> period, when Nguni and Sotho speaking peoples
                  crossed the plateau.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The middle of the century saw two Nguni speaking dynasties
                  established, the Ndebele under Mzilikazi in the southwest and
                  the Gaza under Soshangane in the eastern highlands. Finally,
                  in the 1890s, the whole country was claimed by the Portuguese
                  and the British, the latter making a large-scale settlement
                  under the control of Cecil Rhodes' British South Africa
                  Company (BSAC).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The precise extent and nature of Gaza influence upon the Shona
                  has not been given much attention by historians, largely
                  because the Gaza state moved bodily to the south-east in 1889.
                  Although the Ndebele have been examined more closely, several
                  factors have affected both the available evidence on the
                  Ndebele relations with the Shona and the viewpoints of
                  historians.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Firstly, most European observers of Shona-Ndebele contacts
                  were influenced by the fact that they approached the subject
                  both literally and figuratively from the angle of the Ndebele
                  state itself, which added to the preconceptions they already
                  possessed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Secondly, exaggerated estimates of the number, scope and
                  brutality of Ndebele raids on the Shona were later used to
                  justify the conquest of the Ndebele by the BSAC in 1893.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thirdly, Rhodes' claims to the Shona country were based upon
                  an exaggeration of the extent of Ndebele power. Fourthly, most
                  accounts of Ndebele history after 1840 have tended to
                  interpret the Ndebele in terms of their Nguni ancestry,
                  ignoring the fact that the Ndebele state was a successor to
                  the Shona-speaking Changamire Rozvi state, which influenced it
                  in many ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This article aims to place the impact of the Ndebele upon the
                  Shona in perspective by relating the foundation of the Ndebele
                  state to the Rozvi state it succeeded, and by showing how the
                  balance of power between the Ndebele and the independent Shona
                  changed during the 19th century.

                  The basic population of the area occupied by the Ndebele in
                  the 1840s spoke the Karanga dialect of Shona and was descended
                  from the people of the Leopards Kopje culture, who occupied
                  the area from about

                <p>
                  In the 15th century, people of the Zimbabwe culture moved west
                  into the Karanga country, and some time after 1450 the Torwa
                  dynasty ruled over a state that was a successor to Zimbabwe,
                  based at Khami. Some time between 1644 and 1683 the Torwa
                  dynasty was succeeded by that of the Changamire Rozvi, whose
                  main centres were the stone buildings of
                  <em>Danangombe</em> (Dhlodhlo) and
                  <em>Manyanga</em> (Tabazikamambo).
                </p>
                <p>
                  But although the Khami culture was a continuation of that of
                  Zimbabwe, the Karanga remained the basic population, and by
                  the nineteenth century the Rozvi of the Changamire dynasty
                  were speaking a variant of Karanga.

                <p>
                  The dry environment of the southwestern plateau favoured
                  cattle breeding, and from the earliest days of Karanga
                  settlement the economy of the area was strongly committed to
                  the build-up of herds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, until the early 19th century the goldfields of
                  the area were in production on a reduced scale and the Torwa
                  and Changamire dynasties exported gold and ivory to the
                  Portuguese centres on the Zambezi and the coast in return for
                  cloth and beads, as well as other articles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When, in the early 19th century, the migrations of Mpanga,
                  Ngwana Maseko, Zwangendaba and Nyamazana, set off by the
                  <em>mfecane</em>, struck the Changamire state, it was poorly
                  prepared to stand the shock.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Droughts, wars with the Karanga advancing from the north-east,
                  Tswana raids, strife between the royal dynasty and the
                  <a

                  >
                  and civil wars within the dynasty had seriously affected the
                  strength of a state that had earlier been one of the foremost
                  military powers of southern Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the early part of the 19th century the most important Rozvi
                  families were grouped in a ring around the Changamire capitals
                  of Danangombe and Manyanga east of the Bembesi river. West of
                  the Bembesi, the Khami area was under a Karanga sub-ruler,
                  Ndumba.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most serious split within the Changamire dynasty was
                  between the houses of Mutinhima, a son of the Changamire
                  Gumboremvura, and of Chirisamhuru, who was Changamire in the
                  early 1830s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Mutinhima faction occupied the Mulungwane hills and
                  influenced a wide area east of the upper Lundi. Other Rozvi
                  sub-rulers of the main dynasty were Lukuluba of the Ghoko
                  hills, Rozani of the Vungu river, Swabasvi of the Somabula
                  forest, and a ruler praise-named Dlembeu on the Mpopoti range.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, weakened as it was, the Changamire state
                  withstood the attacks of Mpanga, Ngwana Maseko and
                  Zwangendaba, who were driven off, although they did a great
                  deal of damage, taking grain and cattle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even the death of Changamire Chirisamhuru at the hands of
                  Nyamazana's group did not destroy the Changamire state. It
                  seems likely that no Mambo was installed immediately after
                  Chirisamhuru's death, but at some point well before 1852 his
                  son Tohwechipi succeeded him, and as he received the support
                  of the Mutinhima house he can fairly be said to have been the
                  next Mambo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ndebele invasion differed from those of the Ngoni in
                  several ways. Firstly, Mzilikazi's people made no attempt to
                  attack the central part of the Changamire state, but settled
                  in the western province of Ndumba, west of the Bembesi river.
                  Secondly, they consolidated their power by exploiting the
                  splits between the Rozvi, and by entering into an economic
                  relationship with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main body of Ndebele under Gundwane arrived from the
                  Umzingwani valley in 1838-9. Ndumba's dynasty vanished from
                  the scene relatively early, and the main resistance in the
                  immediate area was led by Mutinhima from the Mulungwane hills.
                  Mutinhima, nicknamed <em>Mafuta</em>, was at first successful
                  in his defense, and may not have been pushed out of the hills
                  until after Mzilikazi arrived.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ndebele succession crisis undoubtedly delayed the impact
                  of the Ndebele upon the Shona, but even so it seems to have
                  been surprisingly mild. There are reports of some raids made
                  upon the local people in the first year, but tradition from
                  the Karanga pointed out that
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    although they killed a lot of people ... none of my family
                    were killed. We did not regard the Matabele as bad people.
                    The only thing they fought over was grain. There was no
                    trouble when the Matabele came.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  This was contrasted with the rapacity of the Ngoni during
                  previous invasions. On the Manzamnyama river the local Karanga
                  fled briefly and then returned as tributaries of the new
                  overlords. In short, west of the Bembesi the place of the
                  Ndumba dynasty was simply taken by Mzilikazi and his
                  followers, who settled down among the Karanga as the Rozvi had
                  done before them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was thus logical that the Ndebele should not remain on
                  hostile terms with the local Shona because they needed
                  supplies of grain, which would not be forthcoming if raiding
                  was continued for a long time. In 1854 Moffat noted the
                  Ndebele prosperity in grain, and in 1858 he confirmed that the
                  Shona were continuing to live inside the Ndebele-settled area
                  in their own villages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ndebele had thus become rivals of the Rozvi as rulers of
                  the Karanga and other Shona peoples, and in the period when
                  the Changamire dynasty was weakened by the death of
                  Chirisamhuru, Mzilikazi actually took his place as overlord of
                  certain Rozvi families of the main dynasty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These, including Swabasvi, Lukuluba and Rozani, may have been
                  motivated by internal political jealousies among the Rozvi
                  such as their exclusion from the centre of power and the
                  succession, but they also had an economic motive. The Ngoni
                  invasions had resulted in the loss of a great number of the
                  prized Rozvi cattle, so that there was a considerable
                  shortage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ndebele, on the other hand, had plenty of cattle but
                  desperately needed more people. The result was that an
                  exchange took place, in which Mzilikazi distributed cattle to
                  the Rozvi mentioned above in return for young people, who were
                  incorporated into the Ndebele state and society.

                  This state of affairs extended over the eastern half of the
                  Changamire state and even as far as Tsunga, the land between
                  the upper Munyati river and the Mwanesi range. There, the
                  Nyandoro dynasty had acted as intermediaries between the main
                  Rozvi dynasty and the peoples north-east of them. At some time
                  before the great campaigns in that direction in the 1850s and
                  1860s Ndebele cattle were distributed there as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was not likely that this situation would endure for long
                  without serious trouble. Firstly, there was the problem of the
                  main Rozvi dynasty, which had withdrawn into the hills that
                  fringed the Changamire state to the east. It was hardly likely
                  to accept the loss of its position without making some attempt
                  to regain it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Secondly, the economic exchange created by the Ndebele was, in
                  the long run, extremely disadvantageous to the Rozvi and other
                  Shona who took part in it. The Ndebele appear to have retained
                  ultimate ownership of the cattle that they distributed,
                  although the milk and limited slaughter rights would
                  presumably have been accorded to the herders, but the young
                  people who were levied by the Ndebele were not allowed to
                  return to their own societies.
                </p>
                <p>Moffat noted in 1854 that</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    There is nothing they deplore so much as their children
                    being taken from them just at a time when they become useful
                    to their parents
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  This practice, taken to excess, could ruin a Shona society.
                  Later the Ndebele did not need to recruit so many from their
                  tributaries, and so caused less damage and created less
                  resentment. But the combination of a serious grievance and the
                  existing organization of the Rozvi state led to the first
                  serious Shona resistance to Ndebele rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is important to stress that the Ndebele did not believe in
                  total war any more than the Shona believed in total peace.
                  During the warfare between the Chirumanzu dynasty and the
                  Ndebele in the 1850s Moffat was able to note that between the
                  fighting in 1854-5 and the surrender of Chirumanzu in 1857
                  there had been no further fighting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In August 1866, the Ndebele attempted to trade with
                  Mashayamombe's people, despite their attack on the latter
                  earlier in the year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for the Shona, even the Njanja, whose exploitation of the
                  Wedza ironfield and wide-ranging hoe selling network was one
                  of the great economic success stories of the late 18th and
                  19th centuries, and who depended for their sales on good
                  relations with the surrounding peoples, did not hesitate to
                  rob Portuguese <em>zungu</em> traders passing through their
                  territory, even though this hardly endeared them to the
                  peoples who expected to receive the trade goods that the zungu
                  were importing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even when Ndebele raids were major ones, directed against
                  specific targets on the orders of the king, there was a
                  tendency for other people in the area to suffer as well. This
                  was because the Ndebele, whose famed military discipline
                  existed far more in the minds of European writers than it ever
                  did in reality, were prone to scatter across a wide area in
                  search of cattle and women. This emerges clearly from all
                  detailed accounts from Europeans living among the Shona.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, quite unlike Montagu Kerr's fictitious stereotype of a
                  surprise attack on a surrounded village, Mauch, in 1872, gives
                  a picture of a series of raids which continued over a period
                  of about three weeks over a very wide front, from the western
                  Duma on the Mtilikwe-Pokoteke confluence to the upper
                  Pokoteke, an area of some forty miles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona, who had at least three days' warning, suffered
                  various losses but were rarely taken completely by surprise.
                  The same picture emerges from accounts of the 1892 raids on
                  the country from Chivi to Gutu and from those of 1893 on
                  Zimuto.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ndebele raiders also tended to follow up their targets if they
                  fled, as when they pursued people from the Chaminuka medium's
                  base near the Mupfure to the northern Shawasha country beyond
                  the Umwindsi in 1883.

                    Lobengula, the last king of the Matebele, gave away mining
                    concessions to the Europeans, though he knew it meant ruin
                    for his nation

                <p>
                  If the main stimulus behind the great Ndebele campaigns of the
                  1850s and 1860s was the political threat of the Rozvi dynasty,
                  the economic stimulus of the Shona trade system was also
                  extremely important. Indeed, it appears to have provoked the
                  first important expansion of Ndebele power.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In inheriting the Changamire state, the Ndebele had inherited
                  its basic economic framework, which, in spite of a regional
                  emphasis on cattle, was also aligned to the traditional
                  exchange of gold and ivory for cloth and beads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, even during the fighting of 1854-5, the trade system
                  linking the Ndebele with the Zambezi and the coast through the
                  north-eastern Shona country continued to function.
                  Nevertheless, by the 1850s it had become clear to Mzilikazi
                  that the Shona were difficult to dislodge from their mountain
                  strongholds. At this point neither side had guns in quantity,
                  although the Shona had been importing a certain number of guns
                  for a very long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ndebele had learned from their experiences south of the
                  Limpopo that guns were useful, and in the 1850s and 1860s they
                  did their best to acquire them. The basic Karanga population
                  of the Changamire state had been accustomed to import cloth,
                  and their needs also had to be supplied.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although supplies of both guns and cloth were available
                  through the variously friendly, neutral or hostile Shona
                  dominions to the east, it was obviously desirable for the
                  Ndebele to control the trade routes to a greater extent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first expansion of the Ndebele was to the north-west,
                  however. One reason for this was probably that the Ndebele
                  state was too weak in the 1840s to attempt the more hazardous
                  (because more heavily populated and thus better defended)
                  route to the north-east.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The badly-watered sand country to the north-west was almost
                  uninhabited and thus offered no resistance to raiders who
                  could easily cross it to strike at the Shona under Hwange,
                  Pashu and Saba on the Deka, Gwai and Zambezi rivers. These
                  people were not only vulnerable but also offered access to one
                  of the trade routes to the sea.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This route was along the Zambezi through the Tonga country to
                  Zumbo, Tete, Sena and the sea, and was economically viable in
                  spite of the distance involved because nearly all the distance
                  could be covered by some sort of water transport.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Water transport, as Selous noted, made goods from these
                  Portuguese ports much more competitive than those hauled by
                  wagon from the South African ports, and in the 1860s
                  Portuguese traders were operating near the Victoria Falls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the early 1850s the Ndebele appear to have established
                  their authority over the Zambezian polities, especially after
                  the death of the Hwange in 1853, although intermittent raids
                  on the area occurred for various reasons as long as the
                  Ndebele state survived.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A Rozvi tradition from the Insiza area suggests that Mzilikazi
                  extended his policy of co-operation with the Rozvi to the
                  point of requesting Chirisamhuru's son Tohwechipi to return
                  from his exile in the direction of the eastern Highlands and
                  settle down in his own country, and that it actually worked
                  for a few years before Tohwechipi broke away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It seems certain that the Ndebele tried to get the Mutinhima
                  house to join them, but that they refused. The 1850s saw a
                  rapid revival of the Rozvi power, and as mentioned above they
                  seem to have sunk their differences sufficiently for the
                  Mutinhima group to recognize the paramountcy of Tohwechipi.
                  Even the Swabasvi house broke away from the Ndebele and joined
                  the Mambo's Rozvi. But it does not seem that there was a
                  single Rozvi command over the rest of the Shona.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even some of the Rozvi under Lukuluba and Rozani remained
                  under the Ndebele, and accounts of the period are full of
                  stories of quarrels and warfare between the Rozvi and rulers
                  such as Hwata, Gutu and the people of the upper Sabi valley.
                  Other Shona rulers did attack the Ndebele at the same time as
                  the Rozvi, but it appears to have been on their own
                  initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the Ndebele exactions of young people provided the basic
                  motive for the Shona resistance to Ndebele rule in the early
                  1850s, and the revival of the Changamire dynasty gave an
                  example to be followed, the resistance took a thoroughly
                  traditional form.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shona raiders penetrated deep into the country of the Ndebele,
                  stealing cattle and (according to the Ndebele) committing
                  atrocities on women. The most prominent of the raiders were
                  the Mambo Tohwechipi, his relative Mutinhima, and Chizema the
                  son of the Govera ruler Chirumanzu on the Shashe. But these
                  raids provoked a Ndebele response that proved too strong for
                  the Shona.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Battles were fought in the mountains to the east of the
                  Ndebele state: at the Mipopoti range against the Rozvi ruler
                  Dlembeu Kupengobuta, at Guruguru (Umgulugulu) mountain, and
                  against the Mhari ruler Zingwe, who was killed for refusing to
                  supply young people as tribute.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tohwechipi was forced to retreat through Chivi past Nyaningwe
                  hill in the direction of Zimbabwe, and it may be near there
                  that he won the defensive battle of Chikato. By employing
                  <em>zvitunya</em> (strong people who came from the Zambezi to
                  trade and who possessed guns) he was able to defeat the
                  Ndebele some time before 1852, winning himself the name of
                  <em>Chibambamu</em> in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fighting continued into 1854, and then there was a lull.
                  But by 1857 the situation had resolved itself in Mzilikazi's
                  favour. The Chirumanzu dynasty surrendered early in 1857, and
                  from then until 1889 became a strong ally of the Ndebele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, Chizema, who had been so prominent in raids on the
                  Ndebele, was aided by them in his unsuccessful attempt to win
                  a new land for himself in southern Buhera in the years that
                  followed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for the Rozvi, they suffered from the lack of unity among
                  the Shona peoples. In July 1857 it was noted that
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The rulers holding these lands [goldfields in the central
                    Shona country] were tributary to the emperor Changamire, but
                    today, by a betrayal, the "<em>Uata Mezir</em>" has taken
                    possession of them from the said Changamire, who lives as a
                    refugee in Njanja, land of the ruler Gambiza, in the
                    district of the Hera, on the edges of his vast domains.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  This <em>"Uata"</em> could have been Mzilikazi, but
                  <em>"Uata"</em> was also the Portuguese rendering of "Hwata".
                  Hwata was the ruler of a comparatively small Hera polity at
                  the head of the Mazowe valley, but if his territory was small
                  his economic influence was considerable. He controlled the
                  goldfields in the northern Shawasha country to the east of
                  him, and the locality of the old Portuguese feira of
                  Dambarare.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This strategic position, probably of importance far back into
                  early Shona history, enabled Hwata to dominate much of the
                  trade of the central Shona country, buying ivory and reselling
                  it to the Portuguese traders, whose houses were to be found in
                  the upper Mazowe valley.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hwata guarded this economic advantage jealously, and when the
                  people near the old feira of Maramuca (probably the Devera
                  group that owned the Shurushuru goldfield) attempted to
                  re-open it to Portuguese trade in c. 1830-50, he attacked both
                  them and the Portuguese.

                  He lost the battle but won the war, for the feira was not
                  re-opened. Mzilikazi devoted as much effort to the defeat of
                  Hwata as he did to Tohwechipi, and the continued subjection of
                  Hwata to Ndebele rule until 1889 suggests that Mzilikazi was
                  fully aware of the economic importance of Hwata's area and
                  intended to profit by it.

                  There seems to have been a period of peace from 1854 to 1860,
                  but from the latter date to 1873 the Ndebele made what was
                  probably their greatest concerted effort to dominate the
                  Shona. They raided over a wide front from Chivi in the east to
                  Mangwende in the north-east and Hwata in the north, and in the
                  northern areas in particular the relatively few raids
                  mentioned in traditions most probably occurred during this
                  period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even so, it does not seem likely that the Ndebele were
                  numerous enough to affect all these areas at once, and in one
                  year, 1863, when the main strength of the kingdom was turned
                  against the Ngwato to the south-west, the only noted effort to
                  the north-west was a raid by associates of the Ndebele on the
                  Deka river area, while another force raided Hwata's associate,
                  Chiweshe, in the upper Mazowe valley.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ndebele effort of 1860 was confined to a small raid to the
                  north-east and another to the south-east. After this, it is
                  possible to make some estimate of the sequence of events in
                  each area affected by the surge of Ndebele activity. In the
                  east, the peoples of Chivi, Bere, Zimuto, and the Njanja were
                  attacked in 1861.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bere's Mhari bore the brunt of the attack, and were severely
                  weakened in consequence, while Chivi's Mhari appear to have
                  succumbed to the power of the newly-imported guns and became
                  tributary to the Ndebele. A combination of ambition on the
                  part of Chivi Matsweru's son, Makonese, and the Ndebele
                  expansion led to the deaths of both Chivi and Bere at about
                  this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The attack on the Njanja mentioned above brought the Ndebele
                  back into contact with the Changamire Rozvi, who had arrived
                  in the Hera country (dominated by the two Hera rulers
                  Mutekedza and Nyashanu and the rapidly expanding Njanja
                  confederacy under Gambiza) by 1857. The Rozvi, led by the
                  Mambo Tohwechipi Chibambamu and his cousins of the Mutinhima
                  house, occupied hills on the frontier between Nyashanu and
                  Gambiza such as Bedza and the Mavangwe range.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is stated that the Ndebele made three major attacks in
                  order to rid themselves of the menace of the remnant of Rozvi
                  imperial power, until in 1866 a prolonged siege forced
                  Tohwechipi to surrender. He was brought to Mzilikazi but later
                  allowed to leave.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tradition is emphatic that he left Mavangwe and went to Gutu,
                  where he died, but in view of the fact that in 1873 Mtikana
                  Mafu led a major force against the Rozvi in Gutu it seems
                  possible that even the defeat of 1866 did not crush Rozvi
                  resistance to the Ndebele.

                  In view of the tendency of Ndebele raiders to spread across
                  country it seems likely that most of the damage suffered by
                  the Njanja and the Hera of Mutekedza and Nyashanu occurred at
                  this time. Certainly by 1870 the Ndebele had raided Mutekedza,
                  since they had mutilated his sub-ruler Nyoka.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This may also be the period of Chizema's attempt to conquer
                  southern Buhera from Nerutanga, which was repulsed by that
                  ruler and the Njanja in spite of his Ndebele backing. The
                  Njanja recall having aided Gutu after this, which may coincide
                  with the 1873 raid there.
                </p>
                <p>The Nhowe of Mangwende remembered in 1898 that</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    it was in following up the Abarosis that the Matabele first
                    came to know our country, with the result that they
                    commenced killing and raiding through the different
                    districts.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The Rozvi were not the only ones responsible, however, because
                  the Ndebele tendency to follow up their enemies applied to
                  Nyandoro of Tsunga as well. Nyandoro had been herding cattle
                  for the Ndebele, but at about this time the murder of an
                  Ndebele nduna led to hostilities, and the Ndebele attacked
                  Tsunga, which was flat and nearly indefensible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was thus one of the very few areas occupied by the Shona
                  that was depopulated by Ndebele action, as the Nyandoro people
                  left en masse in the general direction of their 17th century
                  home in Fungwe. They moved to the nearby Nyoka river, and
                  after a year or two raids pushed them further north-east to
                  the Chirume.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few years later more raids drove them to the Matswitswi
                  caves in Samuriwo's land, from which they fled after
                  Nyandoro's death and further raids as refugees to Mangwende.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like the Rozvi, they brought the attention of the Ndebele to
                  those peoples who lived nearby, so that Samuriwo, Chihota,
                  Svosve and Mangwende all suffered. But, as the Mangwende
                  people pointed out in 1898,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The first time they entered the country very few of
                    Mangwende's tribe were killed, and very few were taken
                    prisoners, but they took away with them large numbers of
                    cattle and goats. The Matabeli never came back into this
                    district again but every year they were raiding the
                    districts on the Sabi river.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  This marked the farthest point of Ndebele raiding to the
                  north-east.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The pursuit of the Rozvi Mambo and his associate Nyandoro led
                  the Ndebele straight to the north-east up the watershed of the
                  whole country, over open, grassy plains. These were of little
                  significance to their economy except as sources of cattle to
                  replenish their herds, after the lung sickness of 1861 had so
                  reduced them that the kingdom actually contracted in size at
                  this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The route to the north, however, not only led to the trade
                  routes of the heart of the old Mutapa state, but was also of
                  considerable economic importance in itself, running as it did
                  through some of the biggest goldfields still being worked in
                  the early part of the century and across river valleys running
                  west from the watershed, that were full of elephants.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The great Ndebele efforts of 1860-8 in this area hit the
                  inhabitants very hard. The Ngezi dynasty of Rimuka partly
                  broke up, and the Mashayamombe and Chivero people of the
                  Mupfure valley also suffered, so that at one point their
                  rulers were forced to flee to the north.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, Mashayamombe at least appears to have returned to his
                  land by 1866, in time to be raided once more. Mzilikazi's
                  attempt to trade for ivory later that year suggests economic
                  motives. Economic motives almost certainly also lay behind the
                  very determined efforts made to subject the Hwata trading
                  centre.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For four years from 1860-1 the Ndebele attacked, even sending
                  Lotshe to raid Hwata's associate and neighbour Chiweshe at a
                  time when the greatest need for men lay on the Ngwato front to
                  the south-west in 1863. Finally Hwata surrendered in 1864, and
                  was captured to be returned to his home as a tributary ruler.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, Hwata, like the Mambo Tohwechipi, appears to have
                  attempted to break away from this relationship, because a
                  major campaign was required in 1868 to subject him again. Even
                  in 1870 his allegiance to the Ndebele was thought to be
                  superficial, but he remained at least nominally tributary
                  until 1889.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After these major campaigns the Ndebele succeeded in making a
                  number of Shona political units tributary to them. This
                  relationship involved the payment of articles of partly
                  symbolic value, such as skins, feathers, hoes, tobacco or
                  spears, or the provision of services, such as labour for hut
                  building.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, such tribute represented a considerable
                  diversion of valuable man-hours among a people living in a
                  largely subsistence economy. Consequently there was a tendency
                  to break away from Ndebele domination.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was noticeable that in many of the tributary lands farthest
                  from the main Ndebele state the tributary relationship took
                  the form of an alliance between a Shona faction, that relied
                  upon Ndebele support against its rivals within the dynasty,
                  and the Ndebele, who themselves could rely upon this faction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This seems to have been the case with Hwata, Mutekedza and
                  Chirumanzu. The main body of Ndebele tributaries was bounded
                  by a line that ran from the Kwekwe river east to Chirumanzu,
                  south to Chivi and then south across the lowveld to Matibi.
                  This boundary varied from year to year, depending upon the
                  political situation in the border areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hwange, the Shangwe of the Mafungabusi plateau, Nemakonde,
                  Hwata and Mutekedza were all outlying tributaries, separated
                  from the main body by almost uninhabited land or independent
                  Shona lands.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The wars of the 1850s established the dominance of the Ndebele
                  in the vicinity of the old Changamire state. The campaigns of
                  the 1860s wiped out the last power of the Rozvi and gave the
                  Ndebele strong economic advantages in the north. In spite of
                  the dissensions of the succession crisis of 1868-72, in terms
                  of relations between the Shona and the Ndebele the latter
                  were, by 1873, at the zenith of their power.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is thus ironic, in view of the myths of Ndebele supremacy,
                  to note that their first serious defeat, and the first sign of
                  a change in the balance of power that was to lead in the end
                  to the revolt of many of the Shona tributaries, occurred only
                  six years later, in 1879. Ironic, but not surprising.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona after all were descendants of the creators of the
                  most impressive Iron Age material culture in southern Africa,
                  the Zimbabwe-Khami culture. They worked what was left of
                  considerable goldfields, and had access to many elephants.
                  Their political institutions and territories were small only
                  by comparison with the few super-states of southern, central
                  and east Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By comparison with most polities of that area many Shona
                  rulers held quite big territories. Most of them owned superb
                  defensive sites. Moreover, developments to the south were
                  beginning to aid the Shona.

                <p>
                  The opening of the Kimberley diamond fields in 1867, the
                  increased availability of guns as Europeans adopted rifles,
                  the expansionist ambitions of Britain and the Afrikaners (and
                  Portuguese counter-moves) all tended to aid the Shona in the
                  short run, though not in the long. Under the circumstances it
                  is surprising that the Ndebele accomplished as much as they
                  did.

                  The sale of gold and ivory and the labour opportunities of
                  Kimberley and the Rand made it possible for the Shona, who in
                  the 1860s had been fatally short of guns by comparison with
                  the Ndebele, to re-arm.

                  Portuguese traders, Venda mercenaries and gun-runners from the
                  Ndebele kingdom, as well as through Shona long-distance
                  traders and migrant labourers, made the hill strongholds of
                  the Shona almost impregnable even against gun-using Ndebele

                    being many days away and the towns denser, the Amandebele
                    are becoming afraid to go there so much. Cattle and sheep
                    and slaves (are) not coming in so freely now from these
                    distant raids ...

                  and it is probable that he was referring in particular to the
                  war with Chivi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the 1860s Chivi was evidently tributary to the Ndebele, but
                  in the reign of Mazorodze, who ruled from 1870 at the latest,
                  the Mhari began to acquire guns from the Venda and to build up
                  a considerable herd of cattle, guarded by a group of men. This
                  represented a threat to Ndebele power in the area, and in
                  October 1879 a major force under Lotshe and Manyewu attacked
                  the Mhari capital of Nyaningwe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the Ndebele force consisted of the
                  <em>mbizo ibuto</em> and probably outnumbered the defenders of
                  Nyaningwe, they were repulsed with the loss of twenty men,
                  their only success being the capture of Chivi himself on an
                  outlying hill. The loss of twenty men was not significant in
                  itself, but the defeat was, and even the execution of Chivi
                  did not hide the fact that although the Ndebele could operate
                  over the open ground, they could not take the hill-strongholds
                  of the Mhari, who were henceforth independent.

                  The year 1880 saw the defeat of the Gaza by Gutu in the
                  similar battle of Rasa mountain, and the beginning of a rift
                  between the Ndebele and their ally the Chaminuka medium of the
                  upper Mupfure. Up to then, Lobengula had paid the medium
                  tribute in return for religious services, and in that year
                  they combined to raid the Shona north of the Manyame.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But at the same time the Chaminuka medium claimed that he, and
                  not Lobengula, had the power to grant hunting-rights to
                  Europeans in the area, and his son Jugu had said that
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    His father would now show Lobengula that the country beyond
                    the Munyati river belonged to him, Chameluga and that if
                    necessary he could drive away the Europeans by his magic
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  It is therefore not surprising to find that in 1883 Lobengula
                  had the Chaminuka medium killed. His men raided as far as the
                  Shawasha country of Chinamhora, whose people had taken
                  Chaminuka's cattle, which in all probability had been taken
                  from them in 1880.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1882 Selous noted that Ndebele had reached the Mukwadzi
                  river west of the Umvukwe range, and in 1887 there was a major
                  raid on the Umvukwe area, probably the one led by Gwasagwasa
                  against the Shona ruler Chipuriro, far to the north. This may
                  have represented a revival of the policy of the 1860s of
                  gaining control of the trade routes to the Zambezi, for beyond
                  Chipuriro lay the <em>prazos</em> of Matakenya (Jose de Araujo
                  Lobo), who had earlier been in contact with the Ndebele,
                  buying their ivory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1888 a major raid struck at the Mashayamombe and Rwizi
                  people of the Mupfure valley. The reason for this is not
                  known. The attack on Rwizi may have been to prevent a renewal
                  of the Chaminuka cult, while the fact that a very large number
                  of people were removed from Mashayamombe's may mean that this
                  was the raid, recalled in tradition, that resulted from a
                  civil war among Mashayamombe's people in which one side called
                  in the Ndebele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it may also have resulted from the fact that the Shona
                  were undeniably growing stronger. Isolated Ndebele were liable
                  to be killed if they were discovered. In 1887 a whole party of
                  Ndebele was killed, and indeed the 1888 raid
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    suffered so severely that Lobengula was very angry and
                    another one was sent out in another direction.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Montagu Kerr, with his preconceived ideas, was amazed to hear
                  the Shona at the head of the Mazowe valley in 1884 coolly
                  discussing their chances of success, with some hope of
                  victory, but it seems that in the 1880s the Shona were indeed
                  beginning to turn the tide of Ndebele power.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This trend was greatly advanced by the Portuguese, who,
                  seeking to counter British expansion by limiting the power of
                  the Ndebele upon which Rhodes' claims were based, sent two
                  expeditions into the Shona country in 1889.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nominally led by Vitor Cordon and Paiva de Andrada, but
                  actually relying upon the forces of such prazo-holders as
                  Guvheya (Manoel Antonio de Sousa), and Chimbango (Vicente Jose
                  Ribeiro), they reached Nemakonde and Mangwende respectively,
                  and made treaties with Shona rulers in a wide belt across the
                  country from the Mafungabusi plateau to the upper Sabi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Portuguese flags were distributed in acts of vassalage that
                  were not taken seriously by the Shona, and large numbers of
                  guns were handed over by the Portuguese. The effect of the
                  treaties was to give nearly every Shona polity north of the
                  Munyati river a considerable increase in the size of its
                  armoury.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Portuguese <em>zungu</em> expedition to the whole
                  Charumbira-Mapanzure-Bere group of peoples in 1872 had only
                  had 48 guns for sale, but the 1889 expeditions gave this many
                  to a single ruler. Even the small polities received ten guns,
                  and powder and ammunition were supplied as well. This was a
                  huge increase in Shona fighting strength, and from both oral
                  traditions and some of Cordon's treaties there is no doubt
                  that the whole tenor of this major political development was
                  anti-Ndebele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The implications of this in Shona history proper cannot be
                  discussed here, but the effect on the balance of power between
                  the Ndebele and the Shona was immense. Hwata, Nemakonde,
                  Mutekedza and some of the Shangwe all abandoned their
                  allegiance to Lobengula and accepted the Portuguese guns and
                  flags which were to be found as far south as the Njanja
                  country and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No major raiding forces of Ndebele ever entered the central
                  Shona country again. There are strong suggestions that the
                  revolt against Ndebele power even extended as far south as
                  Gutu, where from 1889 the rulers no longer had the Gaza state
                  to balance against the Ndebele, and to Chirumanzu, where the
                  death of Bangure allowed his brother Chatikobo, aided by some
                  Rozvi, to lead the people into their first revolt since 1857.
                  But the arrival of the British in 1890 altered the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although there can be no doubt that Lobengula was thoroughly
                  opposed to the arrival of Rhodes' men on his eastern frontier,
                  he remained functionally neutral to the extent that he did not
                  attack the Pioneer column, and once the British had driven
                  away the Portuguese and captured the formidable Sousa, he took
                  advantage of the British presence to regain control over
                  Nemakonde and Chirumanzu, although Hwata and Mutekedza
                  remained lost to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even so, this was only possible with the co-operation of Shona
                  interest groups. In a coup d'etat in 1891, Chinyama, son of
                  Bangure, drove out his uncle Chatikobo and became the new
                  Chirumanzu with Ndebele aid. At the end of the year an Ndebele
                  force visited the Nemakonde area and, after consultation with
                  the most important spirit medium, killed Nemakonde Hodza and
                  four others in an action that has all the marks of a coup
                  d'etat by an internal group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During 1892 a similar split in the Gutu dynasty and an appeal
                  for Ndebele help by Makuvaza led to a joint Chirumanzu-Ndebele
                  force installing him as ruler; at this time a small party of
                  Ndebele even reached the highlands across the Sabi, perhaps
                  the furthest point ever attained in that direction, in this
                  last rather feeble demonstration of Ndebele power.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the events and
                  negotiations that led to the war in 1893 that broke the
                  Ndebele state, except insofar as they concern the Shona. The
                  lowveld area had been subjected to raiding for years, partly
                  at least by unofficial raiding parties, causing Matibi to move
                  away from his northern lands into the remote lowveld in the
                  late 1880s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the decisive area was around Chivi and Zimuto. Chivi was
                  raided in late 1891, to the delight of Rhodes, who was trying
                  to prove Lobengula's dominance of the area, but in July and
                  August 1892 a major raid on the recalcitrant Chivi and Zimuto
                  led to an appeal by Chivi to Rhodes' deputy Jameson.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This in turn led to a demand that Ndebele raiders stay away
                  from the town of Victoria and the main road, a demand that was
                  fully complied with, as far as the Ndebele ruler was
                  concerned, until the crucial raid of July 1893.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even this raid came about partly as a result of Shona actions.
                  Early in June 1893 a joint party of raiders from Bere and the
                  Makamure house of Zimuto stole cattle from Mpakame, a Shona
                  tributary of the Ndebele at Guruguru hill. Mpakame complained
                  to his overlord the Ndebele-rized Rozvi Lukuluba at the Ghoko
                  range.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lukuluba raided Bere in retaliation, but on being turned back
                  by Company police, reported in turn to his superior, Mgandane
                  of Nxa. This led directly to the famous raid in July on Bere
                  and Zimuto near Victoria, to the fight of 18 July and to
                  Rhodes' decision to overthrow the Ndebele kingdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even before the British columns set out, however, Shona
                  raiders were moving in to take Ndebele cattle. As the Victoria
                  column began to move towards its rendezvous in the north with
                  the Salisbury column, it was joined by large forces of Shona.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Zimuto sent 120, Madziviri 50, and Gutu abandoned the Ndebele
                  who had put him in power the previous year and sent 80 men. As
                  the force approached Chirumanzu its ruler Chinyama followed
                  Gutu's example and offered 300 men.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few days later Chivi's men marched through Victoria to catch
                  up with the advancing columns. These Shona, acting in concert
                  for the first time in their particular histories, fought at
                  the Shangani battle with some success, considering that they
                  were left outside the defensive laagers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile in the south, Matibi, whose relations with the
                  Ndebele had been deteriorating to the point of outright war as
                  he was repeatedly raided, experienced a further raid in late
                  1893 and retaliated in force, together with the police. They
                  penetrated deep into Godhlwayo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These Anglo-Shona alliances of 1893 had a profound effect on
                  the subsequent history of the southern Shona, especially in
                  1896. As the Ndebele state fell, Shona raiders from all over
                  the southern Shona country and from as far as the upper Sabi
                  valley began to move towards the Ndebele herds, and the end of
                  Ndebele power in the summer of 1893-4, saw Shona raiders
                  striking deep into the Ndebele kingdom, as they had done in
                  the early 1850s.
