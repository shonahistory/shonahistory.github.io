              <div class="entry">
                <p>
                  Mwari ("<em>He who is</em>") is understood to have been the
                  original ancestor of the people, the first person ever to have
                  been created in Guruuswa, the legendary place of origin
                  referred to many times in Shona clan traditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a spirit and a voice speaking from the sky, he led the
                  first groups from Guruuswa to their homes in the country,
                  <em>nyika dzino</em> (these lands), where their descendants
                  live today. This tradition conceives Mwari as a founding
                  father with a care for all the tribes related to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This universal relation puts him in a different class from
                  that of the founding fathers of clans, making him so ancient
                  as to place him near the Creator (Chikare) and invest him with
                  divine power.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Traditional beliefs are unclear about the nature of Mwari and
                  his relevance to the origins of the world. People believe that
                  he is in some way ultimately responsible for all that happens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He knows everything and sees everything, and is ultimately
                  responsible for the weather, the fertility of the land, the
                  wild forests, character traits of men, and so on. Myths or
                  legends about Mwari are rare â€” certainly less common and less
                  well known than those about lion spirits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Far removed from the family spirit elders who are intimately
                  concerned with the private affairs of their descendants, the
                  Shona high god is too remote and his interests are too broad
                  for him to concern himself with private individuals and their
                  problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He can be ill-tempered and is sometimes believed to cheat his
                  people for no justifiable reason. Nevertheless, in time of
                  extreme emotion, especially at death in the community, people
                  may voice their complaints directly to Mwari; and his name is
                  commonly used as an oath.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It should be noted that the Shona conceive of Mwari as
                  intimately related to major and minor spiritual beings. This
                  conception of the supreme being is far removed from the stark
                  monotheistic idea of God. The high god is believed to be above
                  and more powerful than the lion spirits (<em>mhondoro</em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ultimate dominion over all the country is in the hands of the
                  high god. It is Mwari who provides and owns the wild fruits,
                  game and honey, and who is approached to provide rain and good
                  crops.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These things which belong to him cannot be withheld even from
                  a complete stranger, and the rain he provides falls on all
                  alike. A universal drought that spreads beyond the boundaries
                  of the domains of all lesser spirits is said to be caused by
                  Mwari.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona think of Mwari as above and indifferent to all
                  earthly powers. They would say of a person who is indifferent
                  to the reactions of other people:
                  <em>"Wangova Mwari"</em> (You are now Mwari). They rarely
                  speak about the high god and no attempt is made to communicate
                  with him or to influence his actions either by imprecation or
                  ritual.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Associated primarily with the Rozvi, he did not speak to the
                  people through human mediums but freely from all sorts of
                  things like animals and rocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When, like other African deities, Mwari withdrew from the
                  people owing to their intolerable and arrogant behavior, his
                  place was taken by the clan guardian spirits, the
                  <em>mhondoro</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A large aspect of the Mwari religion was this
                  <em>mhondoro</em> cult whose principal <em>mhondoro</em> at
                  Zimbabwe was Chaminuka. The Chaminuka medium resided in the
                  Eastern Enclosure, and traditions say he used to interpret the
                  squawking of the sacred fish eagle, <em>hungwe</em>, on its
                  annual visits to Great Zimbabwe.

                  The Mwari religion has been headquartered in Matonjeni
                  (Matopos) for the last 500 years. Matonjeni consisted of
                  several shrines of which Njelele is the most known. The Mwari
                  shrines fell, at different times, under the lordship of the
                  Torwa, Rozvi and to a lesser extent, Ndebele state structures.
                  Legend has it that the name comes from ancient migratory
                  <em>njerere</em> birds that signaled the coming of the wet
                  season.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    There was a bird, a type of fish eagle, that lived there. If
                    anything bad was going to happen, it would cry all night
                    long. So they called it <em>njerere</em>, and it spoke of
                    things to come. (T. Chigamba)
                  </p>

                <p>
                  Nguni invasions in the first half of 19th century toppled the
                  Rozvi, but left the Mwari religious structure intact. After
                  occupation of south western Zimbabwe by the Ndebele, Matonjeni
                  shrines were allowed to continue to operate, but under close
                  surveillance. Mzilikazi was dependent upon the Shona spiritual
                  guardians and as a result, he honoured Mwari whom the Ndebele
                  called Mlimo, with annual gifts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the post-Lobengula era the Matonjeni shrines started to
                  exercise political influence in the Ndebele society as well.
                  There were instances that officials of the Mwari religion were
                  consulted on matters of state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the 1896 war, Matonjeni shrines filled the political
                  vacuum created by the defeat of Lobengula by using Mwari
                  <em>vanyai</em> (messengers) networks to coordinate the
                  anti-colonial struggle that united both the Shona and Ndebele
                  people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the war, the Ndebele leadership continued to send
                  messengers to Mlimo for rain while the Shona consultations
                  slowed down especially after the responsible Government in
                  1923 when
                  <a href="./../../../../2023/05/01/rhodesia">colonisation</a>

                  <p>
                    Another contributing factor was the spread of Christianity
                    which resulted in Mwari being appropriated as a Christian
                    god

                <p>
                  Most Zimbabweans are nominal Christians who no longer openly
                  associate with the Mwari religion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The oracle at Matonjeni has shown itself antagonistic to
                  Christianity, both to mission churches and to the new
                  independent churches, on the grounds that they turn people
                  away from ancestor worship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clearly many of the population have rejected the cult in favor
                  of the new religions. Nevertheless the remote high god of the
                  central and northern Shona is becoming more accessible as the
                  Mwari of the Christian missionaries and as the Mwari of the
                  oracles in the Matopo hills.

                    A big assembly was called at Zimbabwe every two or three
                    years. These meetings took place after harvesting time and
                    lasted for three days. A priest assisted by two virgins
                    officiated at the offering of a sacrifice of cattle.

                  <p>
                    He would enter what is now called the temple at Zimbabwe
                    while two virgins clothed in black held plates containing
                    water. The conical tower would open mysteriously as the
                    priest approached.

                  <p>
                    After he had emerged from the tower, six black cattle would
                    be killed by suffocation, their mouths and nostrils being
                    packed with dry manure. The carcases of these cattle would
                    be left out in the veld. If it was found the next morning
                    that they had been eaten by beasts of prey, especially
                    lions, it would be taken as a sign that the sacrifice had
                    been accepted.

                    The meat of these animals was then roasted without breaking
                    any of their bones. At the mountain the trumpets
                    (<em>hwamanda</em>) would sound, the clapping of hands
                    (<em>kuuchira</em>) would be heard, indicating that the
                    sacrifice had indeed been accepted. No officiating priest
                    was permitted to take any intoxicating drink
                    (<em>doro</em>).

                <strong>HOLY DAYS</strong><br />
                <p>
                  Mwari is greatly concerned with the keeping of certain holy
                  days, called <em>chisi</em>, days on which people should not
                  work the soil in any way. Formerly the holy day of Mwari seems
                  to have been the eighth day of the month, called
                  <em>chisi chisere</em>. A well-known Shona proverb runs:
                  <em>"warima norusere"</em> (You have farmed on the eighth
                  day). The figurative meaning of the proverb is: "You have done
                  something which is not permissible and which will get you into
                  trouble."
                </p>
                <p>
                  It appears that usually these days were originally connected
                  with phases of the moon, and later became associated with a
                  particular day of the week (the day varying from area to
                  area). Even among commercial farmers, these days are often
                  still observed, families using <em>chisi</em> to perform
                  weekly tasks which do not involve work on the fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People sometimes have urgent ploughing done by children,
                  explaining that since children do not know the customs it does
                  not matter if they break them. Under the influence of economic
                  demands or of Christianity or of both these, many Shona now
                  ignore <em>chisi</em>, more or less openly, observing only
                  Sunday as a rest day.
                </p>

                  According to Shona religious beliefs, Mwari would chastise
                  those who opposed his will in various ways. He might strike at
                  them by sending war, pestilence, lightning, drought or
                  locusts. He might also withdraw himself so that those who
                  sought his help in times of national calamity, as they were
                  used to in the past, would not be able to reach him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It does not seem as if the Shona believed in punishment for
                  misconduct in life after death. They believed that the human
                  soul or spirit did not die with the body. In a certain sense
                  they held the father would continue to live in his son, but
                  they also believed in a separate existence of the human spirit
                  after death.

                          <em>Mwari</em> - This is now the most common name for
                          the high god, spread by Christian missionaries from
                          the cult in southern Shona country and explicitly
                          associated by many with Christianity.

                          There might be a relationship between Mwari and Muwari
                          (The Strong One) of the Congo. Muali also means sower.
                          In Manicaland the words "Mwari" and "<abbr
                            style="user-select: none"

                        <p>
                          This Manyika use of the word "Mwari" is similar to the
                          use of "Muwali" (a grown up girl) in Malawi. The
                          people of the Zambezi also refer to god as "Muwali".
                          So the Shona also think of Mwari as the god of
                          fertility. He is being petitioned even to this day at
                          Matonjeni for the fertility of crops and barren women.

                        <em>kuroza</em> (to destroy completely), and

                        person). The name describes god as the one who has power
                        to destroy completely good things and persons, and of
                        course, also bad ones.

                        bless) and <em>mauya</em> (a good thing or person). The
                        full name is: <em>Chiraza mavi namauya</em>. Mavi means
                        a bad thing or person. The name describes god as the one
                        who provides for good and bad. The Shona believe that
                        god could also be the author of evil.

                          <em>Musiki</em> - This name designates the supreme
                          being as the creator. It is derived from the verb
                          <em>kusika</em>, which can be translated "to create."
                          The basic meaning of this verb is to make fire by
                          rubbing two pieces of wood together. Thus the Shona
                          also speak of <em>"kusika moto"</em> (to make fire).
                          The Shona idea of creation seems to be that of
                          producing something new by using something which
                          existed before.

                        <p>
                          Furthermore, the name Musiki reminds us of a god of
                          fire. The Shona believe that god reveals his presence
                          through fire. He is present in the shooting star, the
                          flash of lightning or a fire on some sacred mountain.
                          Such fires were supposed not to have been lit by human
                          agency. The idea of god as the god of fire is, of
                          course, common to all religions.

                        therefore: the creator of human beings. The Shona know
                        god not only as the creator of man but also as the
                        creator of all living creatures, but they can only
                        describe vaguely how this creation took place. At
                        various places certain markings on outcrops of rock are
                        supposed to be the tracks made by men and animals at the
                        time of creation when these rocks were still soft.

                        the previous one indicate that the Shona did conceive of

                          But they are also used sometimes instead of Mwari.
                          This practice is somewhat similar to the Jewish custom
                          of substituting Adonai for Jahweh in the Old
                          Testament. Whereas the Jew, however, never ventured to
                          take the name of Jahweh on his lips, the Shona speak
                          of Mwari, Sekuru and Mbuya interchangeably.

                          is derived from the verb <em>kupa</em> (to give) and
                          <em>vose</em> (everybody). When there is an
                          earthquake, a loud peal of thunder or a flash of
                          lightning the Shona take it as a sign that Mwari has
                          passed by. They may then make the following
                          exclamations, clapping hands in reverence:
                          <em>Mbire! Shoko! Mupavose! Dziva!</em>

                        <p>
                          After this, the Shona might call out:
                          <em>"Tachinyei?"</em> (What have we sinned?) The fact
                          that god reveals himself in thunder, lightning, etc.,
                          is considered by the Shona to be an indication of his
                          displeasure. These exclamations may, however, only be
                          an expression of reverence for the divine presence.

                <p>
                  From our study of the names of god used by the Shona we can
                  learn a lot about their conceptions of the supreme being. We
                  note that they know him as the creator, supreme above men and
                  the forces of nature. He is the source of all life, the giver
                  of fertility and rain. He does not exist in only one locality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He has existed before creation. He is very powerful but is far
                  removed from men and concerns himself mainly with the welfare
                  of the tribe. He reveals his presence through awe-inspiring
                  physical phenomena and through fire and is held in reverence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He blesses or destroys both good and bad. To the Shona,
                  moreover, god is a spirit and is closely related to other
                  spirits.
