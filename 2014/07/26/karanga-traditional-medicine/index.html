                  In July 1871, Karl Mauch began his last African journey, from
                  the Transvaal to the Zambezi. He traveled with the minimum of
                  resources and near Zimbabwe he was stranded - to be rescued by
                  an American wanderer,

                      Zimbabwe is a term made of two words, and means "houses of
                      stone." In the form <b>zimbaoe</b>, it frequently occurs
                      in Portuguese records, but it must not be confused with
                      the name of the ruins, the Great Zimbabwe. All the great
                      villages of the Karanga chiefs were called zimbaoe, and
                      were not necessarily constructed of stone.

                  I should like to tell something about the Makaranga tribe. It
                  appears to me best for this purpose to accompany both a girl
                  and a boy through life.

                  <strong>THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN</strong>
                  <br />
                  When young birds have hatched, their parents carry food to
                  them and stuff it right down the beaks of the little
                  loud-mouths. This appears to have been taken as an example by
                  the Makaranga. As early as the first day after the birth of a
                  child, a specially fine porridge of rice-flour or, this being
                  lacking, of ground millet is prepared in order to stuff the
                  new arrival.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Usually it is the grandmother who undertakes this feeding
                  process during the first few days. She takes the child on her
                  lap; the head, anointed with fat, is slightly raised on her
                  bent left arm. The business of forced feeding is begun. The
                  stuffing finger enters well behind the palate; the far too
                  large quantity of the sticky porridge pours down the sides and
                  covers the area of nose and mouth in a dangerous looking
                  manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a second aid the baby, at times almost choking, is rocked
                  by a movement of the legs in the way one shakes a sack to
                  distribute different objects according to their weight. The
                  stomach swells to such a degree that the beholder begins to
                  grow anxious lest it should presently burst.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under this the child has cried so much that it is tired and
                  has fallen asleep; it lies there as if it were dead. Now it is
                  gently taken up with both hands cupping its head and the
                  grubby face is licked clean; <em>waguta</em> (it is
                  satisfied), says grandmother and lays it down again at its
                  mother's side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When, after about four to five days, the mother has
                  sufficiently recovered to be able to undertake once more her
                  daily work, she has the child tied on to her back in a skin in
                  a half sitting, half lying position, the arms and legs
                  protruding through openings. It very soon becomes accustomed
                  to this. Whatever kind of work it may be that the mother does,
                  either in, around or away from the hut, the child remains on
                  her back and neither cold nor rain make any difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus it grows. The teeth appear and are superstitiously
                  observed to see whether the lower or upper ones are cut first.
                  If the lower incisors appear first the baby is disposed of.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It attempts to walk. Already it is receiving, besides porridge
                  and mother's milk, such tasty dishes as
                  <em>mandere</em> (beetles), <em>madora</em> (caterpillars of a
                  giant moth), grass hoppers, field rats, mushrooms, etc. Its
                  body is frequently rubbed with ground-nut oil and several
                  times already has the short, curly hair been scraped off the
                  head, for a Makaranga razor is no keener than a blunt pocket
                  knife.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For some time it has been wearing garments in the shape of a
                  few strings of beads around neck and loins. A child of three
                  eats and drinks everything, whatever the mother wants to give
                  or not to give it; it talks, runs, plays, dances and has its
                  own will which it knows how to enforce by crying. However, as
                  a rule it still drinks from its mother.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>TATTOOING OF THE GIRLS</strong>
                  <br />
                  If the child is a girl and has reached the age of about five
                  years, it is thought desirable to send her to relations in a
                  distant village where she will be brought up, that is, fed and
                  cared for. Here, in time, she learns to carry wood and fetch
                  water, to prepare porridge and relishes, to brew beer and make
                  salt, to mould and burn pots, but she also learns the customs
                  and vices and the superstitious habits of her tribe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The possibly already greying, or else the still young, lover
                  has paid part of the bride-price and the father has very
                  likely told his little daughter all about it. When the time
                  comes that the old women deem the girl to be of marriageable
                  age, then the beauty has to undergo the tattooing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One must imagine the tormenting pain when the whole area below
                  the breasts and the abdomen, from one side to the other, with
                  the exception of a line of one inch width in the middle,
                  receives the round sum of about 4,000 small
                  <abbr
                    style="user-select: none"
                    tip="The incisions (nyora) also aid in identification of the clan, especially those on the face"
                    >incisions</abbr
                  >
                  in the skin, arranged in 30 or more parallel lines, not
                  counting further cuts on other parts of the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore one imagines these small wounds being rubbed with
                  an acid, soot-blackened juice to cause the production of
                  elevated scars. Also one imagines the possibility that, should
                  these 'beauty lines' be found not narrow and high enough, then
                  the torture, which lasts for several days, will have to be
                  repeated. One has to admit that 'Lady Fashion' reigns much
                  more tyrannically there than among other peoples.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>MARRIAGE</strong>
                  <br />
                  By the time the girl has reached the age of between 12 and 14
                  years her education is completed. From now on she has but to
                  wait till her father can come to an arrangement with her
                  suitor concerning the bride-price, if it does not occur to her
                  to elope with the one accorded to her or with a bridegroom of
                  her own choice; the reason for this is not love, romantic
                  love.
                </p>
                <p>
                  How could she know what love is, as this emotion has never
                  been cultivated in her? From early childhood she has been
                  estranged from her parents, has been sold by her father like
                  merchandise; thus she knows no love for her man. At best she
                  prides herself if a lot has been paid for her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the man is capable of keeping her in fear of him then
                  living together will be tolerable; if, however, he is weak or
                  if she should hate him, then she knows only too well how to
                  embitter his life in every way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>WIDOWHOOD AND DEATH</strong>
                  <br />
                  If a woman should survive her husband she is given as heritage
                  to the oldest son of the family, and, should he perchance be
                  her own child, she remains either as matriarch in the house of
                  the family or, if she prefers to, takes another husband.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the first case she becomes a 'snuff-sister', in which role
                  she discusses all the news concerning other families, invents
                  all sorts of lies which she spreads around, and comments on
                  the weather. Thus, for instance, an extremely malevolent widow
                  showed a great ability in discovering the most unlikely
                  reasons why such scant rain fell during my sojourn there (only
                  16 real rainy days during the rainy season):
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    the white man shoots too much (although I killed each time a
                    poisonous and as such, greatly feared snake), the white man
                    made a 'thing' which chases heavy rainclouds away (this was
                    the well-known toy for children, a star made of stiff paper
                    which revolves in the wind and which I had placed on top of
                    my hut), the white man looks continuously at the stars so
                    that no rain should fall (astronomical observations), the
                    white man collects medicines to bewitch the rain (collecting
                    and examining plants unknown to me), the white man alone is
                    the cause of all the ill-luck that must follow the absence
                    of the rain.

                  a cave or a hole in some rocks together with her small grease
                  jar, and the opening is closed by a stone wall. Soon she would
                  be forgotten, did she not now and again appear to the family
                  as a tormentor.

                  <strong>OCCUPATIONS FOR BOYS</strong>
                  <br />
                  As regards feeding and the constant presence of his mother the
                  boy up to the age of five years receives the same treatment as
                  the girls. He is less frequently sent to distant relations to
                  be brought up as he is needed at home to drive the goats and
                  sheep to pasture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Daily one may see him driving them out and returning with
                  them, always keeping them together by whistling and calling.
                  While driving them out he usually carries besides his
                  knobkerrie, bow and arrows, a lump of reddish hard porridge
                  from which he tears small morsels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As goat-herd he occupies a very important position. To
                  encourage him to maintain this position in a very
                  conscientious manner he is given a goat as an installation
                  gift, or pocket money as it were. Only so will 'the pride of
                  the family' look after father's property with any attention.
                  He plays his own games to while away the long day, such as
                  throwing stones or sticks at small mammals and birds; he uses
                  a sling, shoots arrows, has a kind of blunderbuss, sets traps,
                  walks on stilts, etc.

                  According to the season one meets him climbing trees bearing
                  wild fruit, or stealing green maize cobs, which he roasts in a
                  hidden place and enjoys the grains there; thus it often
                  happens on such days that his belly shows much greater
                  dimensions on his return than on his departure in the morning.
                  In spite of this he is always hungry, he even 'dies of hunger'
                </p>
                <p>
                  With great interest he takes part in all conversations around
                  the fire-place in the almost dark hut, whether of members of
                  the family or by visitors. His childish opinions often tip the
                  scales in an argument. In many cases he has by now been given
                  superior clothing for, already, he wears an apron and also a
                  piece of skin to cover his seat.

                  <strong>ADOLESCENCE</strong>
                  <br />
                  The boy has become a fully trained goat-herd by the time he is
                  between 12 and 15 years old. Now he awaits an advancement to
                  become a cattle-herd. To this state he is installed by being
                  presented with a young cow of his own.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this occupation, too, except for milking, he has plenty of
                  time to spare and, according to his inclination, he learns now
                  to make baskets, wooden dishes, knobkerries, bows and arrows,
                  spears, reed traps for fishing and nets of bark-rope for the
                  chase.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many a one also flatters his vanity and coquetry. He braids
                  thin bark-strings, attaches to them pretty buttons and weaves
                  them into his short, curly hair, only to drench this wig with
                  either fat or thick cream whenever he has the opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such a wig is said to be of unbelievable beauty to Makaranga
                  eyes and the aroma of such extravagantly applied pomade is an
                  indescribably sweet perfume to their noses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To while away his time he also twists fine loin strings to
                  which he ties small brass rings or glass beads as a further
                  ornament; he also at this age loves to dance throughout the
                  night in the open air or inside a hut. Should he possess any
                  musical talent he endeavors by day and by night to attain a
                  certain virtuosity by practising and by a rare perseverance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If he is the son of a smith the natural tendency to acquire
                  this art is inherent in him. He shows himself so adept that
                  soon he knows as much about the work as does his fatherly
                  master. Yet he would never dare to equal him in dexterity or
                  the urge for perfection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His weapons such as bow, arrows in a baboon-skin quiver, spear
                  and axe, are now his constant companions to which he likes to
                  add several snuff-boxes in the shape of round bowls made of
                  the fruit of a certain tree, or a small calabash.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One never meets him without these objects, whether he is on a
                  friendly mission or on the war path, driving his cattle or
                  hunting, or simply on a commercial journey or his honeymoon.

                  <strong>COURTSHIP</strong>
                  <br />
                  His principal task now is to look around for a wife and this
                  has frequently its own difficulties. If the young man has been
                  lucky enough to have discovered a sweetheart in some place he
                  visits the village now and again over the years for which
                  occasions he dresses up in the most pleasing and tasteful
                  manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He has polished his body to a beautiful gloss with grease and
                  he does not forget to carry a flawless, polished, highly
                  carved calabash of pleasing shape and size which he has packed
                  with grease.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If he is wealthy, and thus able to pay the price asked by the
                  girl's father, he takes his bride home. But if he is poor he
                  is liable to have to work for years for his bride's father,
                  and is likely to be cheated as was Jacob by his cousin Laban.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Suppose that he really is luckier than the above mentioned
                  biblical father, he either builds a new hut for his wife or is
                  satisfied with a repaired old one. Soon he feels at home in
                  this new situation. Now he has nothing further to do than to
                  assist in obtaining the daily bread, to help in the
                  preparation of the fields and, should he desire to eat
                  sufficiently and to drink beer frequently, to look around for
                  further wives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When he has grown old and, eventually, dies a natural death,
                  he, too, will be placed in a cave. Some of his personal goods
                  are placed there as well and then he is immured and would soon
                  be forgotten did he not now and again torment the family in
                  the shape of <em>mudzimu</em>.

                  <strong>THE TORMENTOR</strong>
                  <br />
                  Thus I have reached the subject of a religious belief of the
                  Makaranga showing that they accept a life of the soul after
                  death, in a certain way, in a transmigration of souls. They
                  believe in a highest being of goodness, called Mwari, and
                  another of evil,
                  <abbr
                    style="user-select: none"
                    tip="an angered ancestral spirit"
                    >Ngozi</abbr
                  >.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The former lives <em>pa denga</em>, that is in heaven; the
                  latter lives <em>pasi</em>, below the earth. They do not
                  consider any thanks due to the former when they receive some
                  favour; in any case, they have no word for 'to thank' in their
                  language. Any luck they attribute solely to their own cunning
                  and skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Does, however, some accident occur, then it is always caused
                  by others, either living or dead. If someone falls ill it is
                  because the family ghost, the mudzimu, revenges himself for
                  the reason that various things had been denied him while he
                  was still living as a man on earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But where does the patient learn the reason for his illness?
                  From the doctor in his or in another village. He is told all
                  about the case. It lies now in the interest of the sorcerer or
                  witch-doctor always to find a different cause for the illness
                  than the mere fact that the patient possibly suffers from
                  indigestion or that he has caught a cold or sprained his
                  ankle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He finds it out very quickly, for he possesses prophetical
                  'woods' the position of which, when thrown down on the ground,
                  tells him the unmistakable reason. Without any doubt it is the
                  mudzimu who once had asked for a goat or beer or a piece of
                  cotton cloth or a knife, etc., and who was denied these
                  things. He declares that the mudzimu now asks twice as much.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The patient has to drink an infusion of some root or other and
                  the relations of the patient have to dance to the sounding and
                  beating of drums in his hut for several nights. Certain
                  incisions have to be made on his body or even on the body of a
                  healthy relative, and so forth. All this has to be
                  scrupulously observed so as to appease the tormentor mudzimu.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the case of death from old age it is again the mudzimu who
                  called. A mudzimu often takes sudden possession of a man so
                  that he is no longer himself. A man acts like a woman, a woman
                  asserts that she is a man, in short, the most horrible deeds
                  are committed. One is vividly reminded of the possessed which
                  are spoken of in Holy Writ and one is sorely tempted to
                  exorcise the devils with a sound beating.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mudzimu frequently possesses animals, such as a goat or a
                  cow, which are immediately treated as if they were humans. If
                  the mudzimu, however, is not on any of his tormenting outings
                  he has to lead a very dull life. He is out in the bush riding
                  around on lions. Besides the mudzimu there are many more
                  spirits who cause evil. Some appear now out of the water or,
                  then again, out of the earth, but they are chased away by
                  dancing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The doctor, however, profits from all this and knows how to
                  get paid for his efforts. Thus, among other things, there
                  occurred the case when a doctor cured a slight indisposition
                  in a poor man's daughter after week-long treatment and,
                  instead of any payment, simply asked to take the cured patient
                  as wife, in spite of the fact that he already had five wives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>PHYSICAL BUILD, CLOTHES</strong>
                  <br />
                  On the whole one may term the Makaranga's build medium. The
                  men are mostly lean people, whereas for a woman to be
                  excessively fat is reckoned to be extraordinarily beautiful.
                  Hands and feet are somewhat larger than proportion demands,
                  the hair is short and woolly and the beard of the man is
                  insignificant. Only rarely does one encounter negroid
                  features.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The narrow, somewhat aquiline nose and the not excessively
                  thick lips in many a physiognomy do not make them appear ugly.
                  This may point to Arab, Malay or Israelite connections in
                  olden days. The color of their skin is of the brown we so well
                  see in roasted coffee beans; but there are transitions to
                  reddish and black without, in the latter case, attaining the
                  velvety black of the Negroes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sartorial artists like tailors and shoemakers, or milliners
                  for the women, would not find any work among the Makaranga.
                  Both sexes wear only a small apron in front and a somewhat
                  bigger piece of skin at the rear. Very rarely are sandals
                  worn, as the necessary thick skin of a buffalo or some other
                  big game is always eaten to the last morsel, it being a
                  delicious relish to be added to the daily food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They know nothing of hats or other kinds of head-covering. The
                  women, particularly, expose their bald, scraped skulls to the
                  singeing rays of the sun and no exception is made where
                  children are concerned. Notwithstanding this, I have never
                  heard of a single case of sunstroke.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They hardly know how to protect themselves against cold and
                  rain by using larger animal skins; they prefer to await better
                  weather sitting near the fire in their huts and they kill time
                  with gossiping which is a highly developed art among them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As ornaments glass beads are strung on a piece of bark string
                  which is worn as a necklace. Also popular are finger-rings,
                  bracelets and leg-rings of iron, brass or copper. The men are
                  less inclined to adorn themselves in this manner, but they see
                  to it that their womenfolk do not lack such ornaments. These
                  constantly wear their wealth of glass beads, which often weigh
                  20 pounds or more, under their ordinary clothes, never over
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Apart from this weight of jewellery their lower arms are
                  frequently completely covered by brass rings and their legs,
                  from just below the knee, are weighed down by metal bangles of
                  finger thickness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In spite of this being so inconvenient whilst doing the daily
                  chores, it, nevertheless, shows that the woman is well-to-do
                  and the ornaments are beautiful and the lucky owner is being
                  adored and envied by the others for it. In addition, there is
                  less danger of the jewellery being stolen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>HABITATION</strong>
                  <br />
                  The frequent raids of their warlike enemies influenced the
                  Makaranga in the siting and building of their villages.
                  Instead of building their homes, as of old, in the plains near
                  their fields, they are now obliged to seek out mountain tops
                  where nature enables them to entrench themselves and, in case
                  of need, to hide in caves into which, quite apart from their
                  families, cattle can be introduced and sheltered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In these caves they find adequate safety but, should the enemy
                  besiege them for any length of time, they will soon be in an
                  awkward position for they usually have not enough time to lay
                  in a sufficient supply of water.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have already described in what manner the individual huts
                  are built. Now I want to introduce the interested reader into
                  one of them and acquaint him with all the implements contained
                  therein.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One observes only objects which are absolutely necessary, as
                  the Makaranga know no luxuries. There are a great number of
                  globe-shaped pots without handles or legs. Their size varies
                  between those which contain four gallons down to others for
                  which even the volume of liquid contained in a teacup would be
                  too great. All are made of sandy clay and become very porous
                  with burning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To obviate this drawback, but in ignorance of the process of
                  glazing, some unripened maize or some paste is cooked in the
                  pot whereby the pores become clogged. The pots serve to keep
                  victuals which cannot be stored in specially built grain bins,
                  as for instance millet, maize and ground-nuts, because they
                  fear to lose them during the night.

                <p>
                  To those already mentioned may be added beans, flour, rice,
                  dried pieces of the stem of sugar millet, mushrooms, meat or
                  its substitutes such as beetles, caterpillars, locusts, and
                  also milk. Further one sees wooden bowls and dishes, pumpkin
                  gourds or calabashes as well as plaited baskets.

                  Stuck into the grass roof are ladles, brushes, feathers, bows,
                  arrows and spears. There also hangs tobacco for snuff, hemp
                  for smoking and the small salt bag.

                  Bed, table or chairs are totally lacking, but never the carved
                  wooden head-pillow, as I would call it. A mat made of grass or
                  reeds serves as sleeping place. The fire place, in the centre
                  of the hut, consists of three stones which form a tripod on
                  which the cooking-pot may be stood in safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I further mention a couple of animal skins which hang on
                  a bark rope which is spanned across the interior, and also a
                  small basket for the brooding hen, I have enumerated almost
                  everything which is stored within the hut.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the outside, large poles and firewood are piled up below
                  the overhanging roof. Nearby lies the mortar fashioned from a
                  tree trunk, 10-12 inches thick, and the pestle belonging to
                  it, which is of heavy and hard wood.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>FOOD</strong>
                  <br />
                  The preparation of their food is simple. The millet porridge
                  must never be missing and a relish to go with it is prepared
                  which, according to the available stores or the season, may
                  consist of stewed bean leaves, ground or boiled ground-nuts,
                  mushrooms, roasted locusts, heated cockchafers, caterpillars,
                  the meat of domestic animals or of game as well as their skin,
                  or of sour milk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Everyone washes their hands as soon as the meal is ready and
                  all members of the family sit on the floor around the bowl in
                  which the meal is being served, with their legs tucked under
                  their buttocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One after the other starts eating, using fingers only, taking
                  a lump of the stiff porridge which he dips into the relish or
                  sauce and allows the morsel to disappear behind the teeth
                  accompanied by continuous smacking of lips and talking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Never does one see two hands in the bowl simultaneously and
                  never is more than a mouthful grabbed. Only rarely is someone
                  so hurried with this pleasant occupation as to help himself
                  out of turn. One eats twice daily, in the morning and at
                  sunset.

                  <strong>WORK</strong>
                  <br />
                  As the Makaranga certainly never take too long over their
                  table and as, on the contrary, these less than lavish feasts
                  are finished in next to no time, an enormous amount of time is
                  left to them for work. But what kind of work is awaiting these
                  people?
                </p>
                <p>
                  It seems as if there were nothing for them to do,
                  nevertheless, one meets with only a very few who could be
                  called genuine loafers. The accomplishment of their ordinary
                  tasks requires the co-operation of all the members of the
                  family.
                </p>

                  The man's duties are to keep the huts of his several wives in
                  good repair, to cut wood, gather firewood in bundles, to make
                  wooden bowls and mortars, to produce weapons, knives and
                  agricultural implements, to go hunting should he want to eat
                  meat or to supply his wives with new garments, to go on
                  bartering trips, to make baskets of tough, flexible tree
                  branches, to weave blankets and sacks from tree bark, to
                  convert forest into fields by stumping, to help with sowing
                  and reaping, to chase destructive baboons away from maize
                  fields, and so on.

                <p>
                  It is the duty of the women to observe cleanliness and order
                  within their huts, to carry water and wood, sometimes over
                  considerable distances, daily to wash, dry, grind and cook
                  millet which is necessary for the daily meals.

                  Their principal work is making ready the lands and they have
                  to prepare salt and beer. The education of the children is
                  their very own task, as the man does not concern himself with
                  this at all. There is certainly enough to do just to be able
                  to live from hand to mouth, and considering this, one can
                  excuse polygamy.

                  <strong>MUSIC, DANCING, HUNTING</strong>
                  <br />
                  The
                  <a href="../../../../2007/06/13/mbira/index.html">mbira</a>, a
                  square piece of wood over which metal tongues (fastened at one
                  end between some thick iron wire and the wood) are made to
                  sound, is the most pleasant among their musical instruments.
                  The tongues are of different length, allowing a formal tuning
                  of from two to three octaves. This instrument is wedged into a
                  very dry calabash by two small pieces of wood.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The calabash has loosely fitted mussel or small shells around
                  the rim of the large opening. The tunes, which are by no means
                  disagreeable to listen to, mostly contain eight beats,
                  repeated ad infinitum. These are accompanied by the singing of
                  improvised texts which have a refrain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another instrument is the 'Job's flute' made of a number of
                  hollow reeds of variable length. Instruments to produce noise
                  are kettle-drums, tambourines and horns of the Sable antelope.
                  One is vividly reminded of the quadrille when watching their
                  dances in the open air. Singing and the beating of drums
                  accompany them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of their most favoured pastimes is the chase, mainly using
                  nets in the way which was very popular in Germany at the
                  beginning of the century. The linked nets may often attain a
                  length of four to five English miles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each owner of a <em>mambure</em> (net) takes up his position
                  behind a scherm of tree branches placed behind the net
                  belonging to him, ready to spear any panicking animal which
                  entangles itself in the mesh, for according to the law of the
                  chase the trophy belongs to him who made the first wounding
                  stab. Such hunting parties, in which the people of several
                  villages take part, often last for several days.

                  When a death occurs the body is buried either at sunrise or at
                  sunset according to the time of demise. First the body is
                  washed, then anointed with fat; the knees are drawn up, the
                  arms bent across the chest the eyes are closed, after which
                  the corpse is partly covered by an old piece of linen or
                  cotton and laid on its right side in a cave, the mouth of
                  which is then closed up by an artless stone wall built without
                  the use of any mortar.

                  In the case of newly born twins, one of them who has been
                  pointed out by the prophetic bones ( <em>hakata</em>) has to
                  be carried into the bush inside a pot while still alive. There
                  it will soon fall victim to hyaenas.

                  Superstition deeply affects the life and behavior of the
                  Makaranga and the most insignificant actions are ruled by it;
                  for instance the placing of firewood in the fireplace, the
                  mode of sitting in the hut, the way of holding a broom or a
                  ladle, even the manner of relieving oneself, etc.

                <p>
                  To ensure the efficiency of a smith's bellows a goat has to be
                  flayed alive, and to make sure that a furnace works well one
                  has to mix a certain medicine with the clay, while porridge
                  and beer have to be supplied during the smelting activities,

                  <strong>LANGUAGE AND HISTORY</strong>
                  <br />
                  In their language one finds elements which are also present in
                  Zulu and Sesotho; in fact, Chikaranga belongs to the large
                  group of Bantu languages which spreads over the whole of the
                  south-eastern part of Africa. Though clicks, as they appear in
                  the Zulu language, do not occur, Chikaranga sounds less
                  pleasant than the Zulu language.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As far as their history is concerned it remains shrouded in
                  the deepest darkness. As they are ignorant of the informing of
                  posterity, either by writing or by carving in stone, of any
                  historical happenings, one experiences the greatest difficulty
                  in separating truth from myth and the fictitious in their
                  changing traditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only from the first decades of the 19th Century does any
                  certainty in regard to their history appear. In the following
                  I shall try to relate what I could find out in this aspect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  About 300 years ago they must have been a powerful people, for
                  their <em>mambo</em> (kings) ruled over the whole country
                  between the two rivers Limpopo and Zambezi. In fact they
                  extracted tribute from places which are well beyond those
                  borders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, such a powerful empire could not last forever, as
                  raiding invasions by other people, the Rozvi, frequently took
                  place from the north-west. To those as well as to the
                  Portuguese they ceded lands.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the Rozvi were concerned not only with raiding, for the
                  wider they spread the better they liked the country. It may be
                  that they themselves were being chased from their homes and
                  thus founded their new homeland here, finally to become the
                  factual masters of the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The empire of the Rozvi in its turn suffered upheavals and
                  dismemberment through the warlike and wild hordes of the Zulu
                  from the east and, soon after, the Matabele, those relations
                  of the Zulu, invaded the country from the west.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First they were led by the father of the notorious and cruel
                  Mzilikazi and later by Mzilikazi himself after he had been
                  chased from the present Republic of the Transvaal by the Dutch
                  settlers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Rozvi resisted the annual attacks and raids for many
                  years. However, as they were attacked and harassed from two
                  sides, their numbers and wealth diminished rapidly and the
                  last Rozvi sovereign Sebamubamu (gun) succumbed in the year
                  1866 to the two-year old efforts at suppression by the
                  Matabele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The majority of the surviving Rozvi people emigrated to the
                  very mountainous part east of the Save river where they should
                  be safe from further raids for the time being. Some others
                  remained as subjects of the conquerors and are, together with
                  the rest of the Makaranga, considered as nothing more than
                  herd boys and breeders of the cattle and goat-herds of the
                  present Matabele prince who, furthermore, exacts a tribute in
                  arms and cereals from them each year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Notwithstanding this, he allows his troops to undertake short
                  raids against them. Whoever pays the tribute, which is being
                  increased every year, may live in the uncertain hope that he
                  will not be bothered again in the near future, but he who
                  refuses will certainly be made the target for a quick raid by
                  night when there will be no time to put his own person in
                  safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The inescapable consequences of such a refusal are death for
                  the men, the old women and the young children, captivity and
                  slavery for the young women and girls, loss of all property
                  and destruction by fire of all habitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For years now it has been like that and will remain so in
                  future until the country will be barren, like that part in the
                  north-west where numerous remains of burnt villages, bleached
                  bones and large deforested tracts of land which still show the
                  furrows of erstwhile agricultural enterprise, are witness to
                  the presence and lust for destruction of the Matabele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This, therefore, will be the probable fate of the Makaranga
                  amongst whom I spent nine months, from September 1871 to May
                  1872.

                    returned to Germany he didn't even let his parents know he
                    was back again. In his diaries he expresses in no uncertain
                    manner his distaste for the English, the Boers, the
                    Portuguese, not to mention the Africans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Towards the end of his African adventures the hardships of
                    his journeys and a mysterious illness had reduced his
                    intellectual powers to a shocking extent. By then Mauch was
                    no longer the heroic discover of Zimbabwe but a poor,
                    confused wreck of a man.

                    His death occurred as a result of a fall from his bedroom
                    window. During the night he fell onto the cobblestones of
                    the road below and some hours later was found with multiple
                    injuries and a cracked skull. He died in Stuttgart on 4
                    April 1875, in his 38th year.
