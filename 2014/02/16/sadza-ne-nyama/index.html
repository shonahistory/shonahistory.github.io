                  Very rarely is food just something to eat. Culture cloaks it
                  with infinite gradations of meaning, elaborates or adorns it
                  in many ways. Culture prescribes when we should feel hungry,
                  i.e., the proper mealtimes; it prescribes what foods are
                  appropriate to which hour (porridge and marmalade do not
                  belong to the dinner table) or to the occasion; the manner of
                  serving them, the sequence in which they follow each other
                  (soup first, sweets last).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The contact of white culture with that of the African
                  disturbed and disrupted traditional food habits. For instance
                  there was a widespread shift from millet (<em>rukweza</em>) to
                  mealie meal as a result, among other reasons, of the labour
                  saving effect of buying meal. This change was encouraged by
                  the absence of men at work throwing added economic burdens on
                  the women. Its significance was the release of women from the
                  arduous task of crushing grain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fact that the African has lived in Africa for centuries
                  justifies us in assuming that the food he has learned to
                  acquire, identify and grow was adequate enough to maintain
                  life over hundreds of years in his specific living conditions
                  such as consumption of human energy, hours of work, recreation
                  and rest, seasonal change, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The white man came and promptly began to disturb the old
                  balance between native life and food. In employment the
                  African labourer found himself called upon, with ever
                  increasing stress, to expend an amount of energy, to maintain
                  a rhythm of labour under white supervision out of all
                  proportion to the contribution of energy, vitality and health
                  made by his food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the paced life of the kraal with its unregulated,
                  personal control of manual labour based on impulse and
                  inclination, to the eight to twelve hour working periods under
                  white supervision is a revolutionary change demanding an
                  equally revolutionary dietary change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Food consumption in the kraal was controlled and distributed
                  through the months of the year by a woman wise in housewifery.
                  Grain was stored in a bin called a <em>dura</em>, and the aim
                  of all preceding agricultural activity was to fill these bins.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was accepted that only an old woman, not any woman, could
                  properly control the issue of food from a grain bin. The
                  novice would issue too much, the bin would be emptied too soon
                  and hunger would arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All wives had their bins; but from the main bin, the husband's
                  bin which is the kraal's reservoir, no one but the chief wife
                  (<em>vahosi</em>) could draw grain. As the minor bins were
                  exhausted in the course of the year so each wife came to
                  depend on the chief wife and her control of the principal bin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On a woman's judgment and experience depended the food
                  consumption of the kraal and if we remember that she budgeted
                  for the whole year while the white housewife was concerned
                  with a weekly or monthly wage, we can appreciate the degree of
                  skill required. The African man had as little share in this
                  sphere of knowledge as his white counterpart.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That the whole scheme of food activity was a very precarious
                  and hazardous business in African life is shown by the
                  prevalence of magic. Some further safeguard to skill and care
                  must be found if widespread and constant anxiety is not only
                  to oppress the kraal to dull initiative and energy in food
                  activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Relief was sought in magic and that there was medicine called
                  <em>divisi</em> in all grain bins may be taken for granted
                  unless, as sometimes happens, one was so unfortunate as to be
                  unable to acquire it and so ran a grave risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This <em>divisi</em>, this life insurance as we may call it,
                  was once a human head. It was obtained from medicine men and
                  from the Zambezi river monster Nyaminyami. It had two uses.
                  Like a fertiliser it was put in the lands to ensure good crops
                  and quick growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was also put in grain bins to ensure that the grain was not
                  finished too soon and also that you got maximum satisfaction
                  out of eating it, i.e., you felt full on a little.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An African who could be induced to speak about it would assure
                  you that a supply of grain which would suffice perhaps for
                  nine months would last the year if mixed with <em>divisi</em>.
                  and also that you needed only to eat a little to feel full.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clearly the African expected and was accustomed to food
                  shortage since it was only through magical protection that he
                  could hope to meet and survive the vicissitudes of the year.
                </p>

                    Some people have a type of medicine that is called
                    <em>divisi</em>. With that medicine, if someone farms a very
                    small area, a single acre, that acre can give him two, four,
                    or even five tons of maize. Yet you farm five acres, and
                    fail to harvest even one ton. So, what is happening is that
                    he is coming into your fields, and taking your seeds, and
                    causing them to move into his field. That is what people do;
                    that is <em>divisi</em>. (T. Chigamba)

                  <strong>USAVI</strong><br />
                  Sadza is, above all, the African's food. No meal is complete
                  or satisfying without it. But just as essential is a relish of
                  some kind, called <em>usavi</em>, and in these is to be found
                  the highest art of the housewife. Many and varied are the
                  recipes for <em>usavi</em>, they disprove emphatically that
                  the diet of the tribesmen is monotonous and dull.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact the wide fault that tribesmen found with their food
                  when at work was its monotony. Some tribes, as for instance
                  the Shangaan of Ndanga, were acknowledged by their neighbors
                  for their skill in utilising their environment for the
                  preparation of <em>usavi</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The importance of <em>usavi</em> cannot be overestimated and
                  it is stressed because of the popular view that all an African
                  requires is sadza.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    If our grain bins were full and we had no <em>usavi</em> we
                    would be hungry
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  they say, and an observer has only to note the attention and
                  effort given to the collection of material for
                  <em>usavi</em> to appreciate its importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is the hurried collection of
                  <abbr style="user-select: none" tip="amaranth, bonongwe"
                    >pig weed</abbr

                  while weeding a farmer's lands, which the boss may forbid as
                  interfering with his work. There is the strenuous labour of
                  cutting down trees to capture a locust swarm before the early
                  sun warms their wings, an organised effort so strong as to
                  denude hillsides of their trees.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So essential is usavi that in a bad year Africans are to be
                  found gathering roots and herbs which are highly unpalatable,
                  bitter, and full of tannin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An instructive sidelight on Karanga ideas about feeding is
                  provided by their language terms. A good meal is one in which
                  sadza and usavi just balance. Usually they eat till the usavi
                  is finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sadza that remains over is called <em>nzuwa</em>, and to
                  eat this "sadza without relish" is not <em>kudya</em> (to
                  eat), but <em>kutemura</em>. This nzuwa may be kept over
                  during the day and is then called <em>muswedzwa</em>. If kept
                  over to the following day it is called <em>muradzwa</em>. It
                  is for muswedzwa that visitors ask if they arrive at a kraal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sadza without usavi is hardly recognised as food and a proper
                  proportion between the two is essential if one is to be well
                  fed or, indeed, if he is to consider he has been fed at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Increased bags to the acre may in fact be useless from a
                  nutritional point of view if there is a shrinkage in the
                  vegetable, animal and insect matter that goes towards usavi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally it must be noted that a meal is comprised of sadza and
                  usavi only. There are no separate dishes or additional courses
                  such as form part of European arrangements. People actually
                  dislike the idea.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    We would vomit if we took a bit of potato, a bit of cabbage,
                    a bit of meat, like you do
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  There is a hint of scorn in the idea of nibbling at various
                  little dishes. African children are always nibbling and
                  scrounging for food, but when they reach the age of about
                  eight they will be lectured and scolded for such behavior. A
                  grownup does not eat between meals, it is childish.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is in the usavi dishes that the dietician must search for
                  the source of all those food values which sadza does not
                  provide. In general the mice hunts, the game net, the fish
                  trap, the search for herbs and wild fruit, the ant trap and
                  the pumpkin patch, each working in an intricate context of
                  traditional experience, have but one end; the augmentation and
                  variation of the usavi dish.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This will make it clear that bachelors at work are liable to
                  feed themselves inadequately unless usavi is issued to them
                  and why they should be so full of complaints. The appetising
                  quality and variety of their food depends on the art of usavi
                  cooking and without a wife to ensure this their enjoyment of
                  food and their diet suffers. The copper mines found that

                    for every married man admitted to hospital there were two
                    bachelors admitted, and cooking the food for bachelors
                    brought about very good results ... and an improvement in
                    general physique because bachelors neglected to cook the

                <p>
                  The distribution and apportionment of food is governed by
                  complex rules of etiquette which define the behavior of
                  different age grades, young and old, seniority, of the sexes,
                  of different relatives, of strangers.

                <p>
                  Everyone knows his place. How very rare is there any trouble
                  over the sharing of food, even when starvation is abroad and
                  appetites might be expected to overrule manners!

                  Men and women never sit together, or only on special occasions
                  such as in marriage rites. Nor do those between whom there is
                  any ill feeling:

                  The meal is essentially a communion and is ceremonially used
                  as such when reconciliation or new social bonds are to be
                  proclaimed.

                  Young men await their elders and a youth would not start until
                  told to do so by his father. A boy may only dip his lump of
                  sadza (<em>musuwa</em>) into the gravy (<em>muto</em>) and not
                  remove any lumps of meat that may be in the usavi. His father
                  must do that for him.

                  Different relatives have all kinds of special privileges over
                  food: a wife must keep certain delicacies, such as a special
                  rodent (<em>mbeva</em>), for her husband and not eat it
                  herself.

                  Their insistence on the sharing of food is a remarkable
                  element in their culture. From the earliest years a child is
                  taught to share his food, that he must never eat alone, and,
                  at the same time, learns to share in the food of others as a
                  matter of course. To share in food is no occasion for
                  gratitude for thanks, it is the natural thing to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is not hospitality in the European sense of the word, it is
                  just the natural and proper thing to do. Labourers will deny
                  themselves food to allow visitors a share. One trader
                  remarked:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Parents visiting the store have to buy their children
                    packets of biscuits to keep them quiet, and I often wish
                    that white children were here to see the unselfish way they
                    are handed round
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  To eat by oneself is very bad manners, and, when necessity
                  demands it, a man will always turn his back on those present
                  while eating by himself. This sharing habit is intimately
                  associated with their whole mode of life, but it is already
                  being undermined by the cycling mobility of modern times.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the face of it, all such virtues as thrift, good husbandry,
                  preparation for a rainy day, all those mental attitudes which
                  mean a restriction on food sharing, are in direct opposition
                  to their whole system of life; in fact, European virtues would
                  be vices if transplanted without modifying the culture to
                  receive them.

                  It has been wisely asked wether the Africans will continue to
                  be so generous when they can conceal their food supplies as
                  effectively as the whites do. The privacy of the pantry is a
                  very different influence from the publicity of kraal
                  housekeeping.

                <p>
                  <strong>THE GOOD MEAL</strong><br />
                  The African idea of the "good meal" or a "square meal" is a
                  very important factor. The sign of the end of a good meal is a
                  full stomach. They will indicate a distended stomach and their
                  talk becomes animated at the thought of it:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>If our stomach does not fill up we are still hungry.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Unless there is this sensation at the end of a meal, he will
                  not feel he has eaten sufficiently, and to this end stodgy,
                  heavy, sadza is the finest food. Weight of food is most
                  important.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One might say that the absence of stomach strain connotes
                  hunger and when we consider actual foods we shall see that
                  "foods which keep in the stomach" are favored for long
                  journeys or special hard work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A further background to this idea of how good a square meal is
                  must be noted, indeed it is a background to the whole attitude
                  to food. In white culture food is a regular routine affair
                  that never varies, so clock-like in its arrangements that it
                  is taken for granted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To the tribesman, food has no such pleasant guarantee. His
                  experience of it ranges from months of starvation, when every
                  mouthful counts and every seed is swept up, to periods of
                  profusion, to that happy times of <em>zhizha</em> when "there
                  is so much food you can refuse it" (February to March).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The emotional values behind his food are high and varied,
                  rising as they do out of such fluctuating experiences. The
                  intensity of this attitude to food is often reflected in the
                  assault and culpable homicide cases which come before the
                  courts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That a wife did not have food ready for her husband is
                  regarded as a legitimate reason for beating her, and often a
                  husband goes too far especially after beer and lands himself
                  in crime.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Food, therefore, is intimately associated with most of his
                  pleasures and sorrows, of his joys and tribulations in a
                  manner whites are unconscious of in their culture, which has
                  rendered food consumption so independent of the anxieties of
                  life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This view, combining with his idea of "the good meal,"
                  explains why the tribesmen will always eat all he can in one
                  go; eat a big buck in one evening and never dream of spreading
                  it out over several days, even with famine about him. Food is
                  much too important inside the stomach to trifle with outside.

                  <strong>FOOD TASTES AND DIET IDEAS</strong><br />
                  These vary from tribe to tribe and even by localities. Even
                  close proximity of tribes with different principal crops,
                  different relishes and modes of cooking has not meant much
                  diffusion from one to the other, but rather attitudes of
                  scorn, contempt and repulsion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even so universal a dish as sadza is made according to taste
                  in consistency, heaviness and fineness of grain. Badly cooked
                  sadza is called <em>mbodza</em>.

                <p>
                  <em>Upfu hwaka mwazhika</em> is gritty meal and is very much
                  disliked. People will prefer to buy native ground meal, and
                  they will walk great distances to a miller whose mill is famed
                  for its fine milling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A trader whose mill is wider than 24 mesh will attract very
                  few customers, though it is interesting to find that such a
                  mill sometimes does quite well because customers think they
                  are getting more meal, since such a coarse meal does not pack
                  so closely in their basket.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the same time such a miller finds a ready sale for sieves,
                  as his customers will sieve the meal and use the coarse
                  portion for beer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the average trader's mill is a 24 mesh the tribesmen is
                  increasingly tending to buy from the big milling companies
                  where he can get the fine No. 1 or 30/32 mesh meal and even
                  the refined Pearl meal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He does this, not to copy the whites, but because these
                  refined meals are the closest approach to the old original
                  fineness of grain which a pair of stones (<em
                    >guyo and huyo</em
                  >) once ground out in the kraal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This insistence on fineness of grain has most serious
                  consequences, for it means that the staple food of the
                  population is being deprived of its dietetic values.

                <p>
                  There are two kinds of sadza. The proper sadza which is
                  carefully prepared by first adding a cupful of thin paste
                  called <em>mususu</em> (a handful of meal mixed in cold water)
                  to the pot of boiling water. When this mixture bubbles it is
                  said to <em>kukwata</em>, and it is then, if the men be near,
                  that the woman puts the twirling stick with prongs
                  (<em>musika</em>) into the pot and, turning to the men, asks,
                  <em>"May I stir my pot?"</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The answer to this little ceremony of politeness is,
                  <em>"Please stir, Mother,"</em> and she slowly proceeds to add
                  meal by the handful, rotating the musika all the time until
                  the sadza is too thick and she has to use a stirring stick
                  (<em>mugoti</em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meal is added until she judges the sadza is just right; it
                  must not be too thick or too watery. Care is taken by a woman
                  to serve this to her husband in a becoming way. Nicely
                  rounded, shiny lumps are made with a wooden spoon
                  (<em>gwaku</em>) and piled on top of each other
                  (<em>zvitina</em>) on a plate (<em>ndiro</em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The other kind of sadza, usually made by men or when in a
                  hurry, and certainly not a proper dish to be set before a
                  husband by his wife, is known as <em>sadza roku bvurwa</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The meal is added to boiling water without first adding the
                  thin paste. Only a mugoti is used to stir it. This, they say,
                  causes the sadza to be lumpy, the small lumps containing a
                  kernel of uncooked or improperly cooked meal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This sadza is made when hard work or a long journey is about
                  to be started; it can be felt in the stomach for a long time
                  afterwards; a man then does not feel hungry, can go without
                  food, and has plenty of strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When coarse meal is prepared in this hurried way it usually
                  results in the meal merely being scalded, and consequently it
                  continues to swell and expand in the stomach. If the man has
                  filled himself to capacity, this further unforeseen expansion
                  inevitably causes stomach trouble. Hence the "alleged stomach
                  trouble" caused by coarse or husky meal is usually quite
                  genuine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One pound of dry mealie meal becomes two pounds of
                  <em>sadza roku bvurwa</em>. Of men who had eaten the previous
                  day, one pound of <em>sadza roku bvurwa</em> were eaten, while
                  of proper sadza one ate three pounds at a sitting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is significant, for tribesmen admit that they are unable
                  to eat as much of <em>sadza roku bvurwa</em> as of the proper
                  sadza, and tests show that more than twice the quantity of the
                  latter as compared with the former can be eaten. It must be
                  remembered that these were meals without usavi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This means that labourers who habitually eat
                  <em>sadza roku bvurwa</em> are not consuming the same amount
                  of food as those with wives. Men dislike cooking, specially
                  after working all day, so they will skimp the business of
                  preparing proper sadza, and the acquisition of a temporary
                  wife is a useful way out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Maize meal sadza is said not to be so satisfying as millet
                  meal. The latter gives more strength. So the shift from millet
                  to maize has meant a deterioration in their food, for those
                  people who hold that view. Many still keep to millet sadza,
                  and when a Shangaan woman said that sorghum meal was better
                  than millet her Karanga husband indignantly argued against
                  her.

                  <strong>EGGS</strong><br />
                  This dietetically valuable food is not eaten amongst most
                  tribes. One source in Darwin admitted that he was tabooed
                  eggs, but generally the answer is
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Eggs do not like to stay in the stomach; we would vomit.

                  Only persons possessed by a <em>shave</em> spirit, the
                  <em>shavi re murungu</em>, will eat eggs; the spirit calls for
                  them and eats them raw. That a spirit should call for eggs is
                  a sign that the eating of eggs is abnormal. Some will say that
                  eggs cause impotency and that women avoid eggs for fear of
                  childlessness.

                  <strong>VEGETABLES</strong><br />
                  Tribesmen have a definite prejudice against eating raw
                  vegetables, and even during the rainy season of green
                  vegetables they tend to be held over and dried. So lettuce is
                  ignored. Cooked vegetables (<em>muriwo</em>) are eaten with
                  discrimination.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mines found that carrots, turnips and leeks had to be put
                  in a previously prepared stew before their labourers could be
                  made to eat them; others had to go further and chop up
                  vegetables very finely in a stew to prevent their removal.

                  Enquiries indicate that pumpkins, spinach, pumpkin leaves,
                  brinjal, marrow, kale and turnip tops require no persuasion,
                  but that cabbage sometimes requires a little time "to put
                  over."

                  Tomatoes, though they prefer to sell them to whites, are
                  appreciated. Potatoes, beans and monkey nuts are, of course,
                  well known native foods. Beans must be free of weevil or
                  borer, for people believe that such infected beans cause
                  diseases of the stomach.

                <p>
                  Mention might be made here, as an instance of ingenuity in the
                  acquisition of food, of the lower Lundi Shangaan who live in a
                  starvation area.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The potato tops of the normal crop are cut and planted out as
                  "cuttings" in the sandy bed of the river. There they remain,
                  throwing down roots to the water below, and by October these
                  have swelled out to form finger like potatoes that provide
                  those extra mouthfuls which are so necessary in that time of
                  the year. The sight of potato tops growing on the white river
                  sand is a surprising one till the secret is revealed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tribesmen have an expression,
                  <em>"muriwo uno gura mabvi,"</em> meaning "vegetables cut the
                  knees." A man will use this after having eaten a lot of
                  vegetable usavi because nothing else was available. It is a
                  laziness from the knees; he just wants to do nothing and has
                  no energy. The vegetable is not an energy producing food, in
                  their opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a very large number of different vegetable growths,
                  and fruits and nuts, which are collected from the veld. Some
                  varieties are very attractive dishes, but the collection of
                  others is a sure sign of a bad year, of a time when the
                  tribesman is hard pressed to find anything for the usavi dish.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is not as a food, not because of any recognition of the
                  food value of vegetable matter, that they collect and eat it;
                  but simply as an ingredient of usavi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So too many vegetables upset the balance between sadza and
                  usavi; the usavi dish is too small to take too large a
                  quantity of vegetables. If there are plenty of rats or similar
                  meat delicacies obtainable, it will be the vegetable ration
                  that is ignored.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Generally, a tribesman will account for an aversion by saying
                  it makes him vomit, in much the same way as a European would
                  say he feels ill at the idea of eating locusts or snake, but
                  there are deeper taboos and beliefs which are difficult to
                  reach and are often found only by accident. Much too easily
                  does the tribesman offer an explanation that is only
                  camouflage. We hear that
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    green vegetables are often looked on as women's food and
                    likely to make a man sterile, also onions and leeks.

                  A dish that might be mentioned here is called
                  <em>mutakura</em>, and is recognised as the most strengthening
                  and lasting food the tribesmen have. It is a mixture of beans
                  and whole mealies boiled together. Any very hard work, any
                  anticipated delay till the next time food is obtainable, a
                  long journey, are all occasions best prepared for on
                  <em>mutakura</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>MEAT</strong><br />
                  The tribesman will do anything for meat, and draws on unheard
                  of springs of energy when meat is the inducement. As a general
                  rule, it might be said that meat, under old cultural usages,
                  was only available on ceremonial or ritual occasions; a
                  sacrifice to the spirits, the sacrifice of a beast at burial
                  or inheritance ceremonies, the ceremonial feasts at marriage,
                  the fine of a beast paid to a chief, the ceremonial
                  reconciliation of opponents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because of the custom of slaughtering for a feast, the largest
                  number of kinsfolk would share in it so that at no time would
                  a large quantity per person be available; but again there were
                  certain feasts restricted to very special relations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is also complicated by the rules of apportionment, there
                  being well recognised parts of a beast which are reserved for
                  special people, the chief's portion, the spirits' portion, the
                  deceased's sister's portion, and so on for various relatives
                  according to social status.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To this exploitation of domestic resources must be added the
                  more uncertain meat supply of the veld. That this was a most
                  important activity is certain. Tribal hunts took place on a
                  grand scale. There were and are hunting spirits, magical
                  guarantees of success, the forecasts of the "bones," many
                  traps, and a large body of traditional lore and skill in the
                  acquisition of game, birds, rats and fish.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Generally we can say that meat was a sufficient rarity to make
                  any occasion a most significant one, and to this must be added
                  ceremonial and ritual values. The feelings and emotions behind
                  meat are deep ones. Its consumption marked an occasion of
                  special joy or special gravity, so it attains to and provokes
                  a cluster of emotions far beyond its significance as an item
                  of food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Anyone who has stayed to watch the scene round a big kill,
                  particularly an elephant, will never forget the complete
                  enthusiasm and frenzy, when knife and axe cuts on legs and
                  hands pass unnoticed, and the tribesman literally throws
                  himself into the meat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here is the highest pitch of excitement, the unexpected gift
                  of enormous quantities of meat; but all the way down the scale
                  to a ration of one pound per week these culturally formed
                  attitudes towards meat are present and are ready to find
                  expression in terms of the quantity and the significance of
                  the occasion. Such "kills" remain red letter days in the
                  history of the tribe, never ceasing to provoke animated
                  memories. Such is the meaning of meat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within this general attitude to meat one may come across many
                  specific taboos characteristic of various tribes. There is the
                  well known one of people as the WaRemba which forbids them to
                  touch meat they have not themselves killed by cutting the
                  throat; there are people, mainly differentiated by totems, who
                  may not eat sheep, goats, pigs, different species of buck,
                  various portions such as the heart, the marrow, the brains,
                  and the legs of the animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not only do traditional taboos operate, but new ones sweep
                  into power such as the prohibition against pigs among the
                  Zionists and the "Apostles" (mapostori) who will refer you to
                  the Bible and the evil spirits which entered into swine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course, in the reserves the "Cattle Complex," which is a
                  real psychological complex buttressed by religious, social,
                  ceremonial and social status motives, is an enormous barrier
                  between the tribesman and an ample source of meat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is a fine example of how culture can restrict a people's
                  food supply; the urge of hunger, even in a famine area, is not
                  strong enough to overrule the cultural attitudes towards
                  cattle and the place they hold in hearts and minds and daily
                  life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong> <br />
                  Locusts, flying ants, ants and caterpillars are regarded as
                  great delicacies, worthy of hard work and great patience.
                  Their food value is higher, caterpillars particularly having a
                  higher protein content than meat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A tribesman is always on the alert for honey; he has his hives
                  and his magical medicines to protect them. In stores he will
                  buy sugar and eat it as we do sweets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A shortage of salt expresses itself in a deep craving and
                  varies considerably in different parts of the country. In the
                  Zambezi Valley salt will carry a traveler anywhere and assist
                  him from any difficulty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not a grain will be ignored if it falls on the ground, and a
                  handful of it will be eaten ravenously. Salt pans are a source
                  of tribute and of prestige to the controlling tribe. Certain
                  plants are burned and the ashes provide a salt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fruits such as oranges are such a completely new taste that it
                  is difficult to generalise, but such incidents as that of the
                  farmer who found that orange extract had to be administered
                  compulsorily by the spoonful and later had to guard the bottle
                  to prevent it being drunk straight off, and another who
                  suddenly found his orchard, which had stood unmolested for
                  years, requiring protection since he started to educate his
                  labour up to vitamin C, are indicative of how quickly this
                  taste can be acquired.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A tribesman suffering from bad gums and teeth was startled by
                  the simple prescription of "eat an orange a day for a week,"
                  and later astonished by the sudden cure. News such as this
                  spreads widely. Orange and lemon juices are also believed to
                  have aphrodisiac properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />
                  The most important foods that the tribesman not only lacks but
                  culturally avoids are milk, eggs and green vegetables. His
                  basic food is being deprived of its nutritive content as the
                  purchase of refined meal spreads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We see then, that if "man is first of all a nutritive
                  process," that the tribesman's selection of the substances
                  that are available is a dietetically unsound and eroding
                  influence on his physical and mental makeup.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His traditional or "natural" food is not the fine thing so
                  many hold it to be, and in the new environment in which he is
                  expected to work it is so out of place as to cause serious
                  malnutrition and disease.
