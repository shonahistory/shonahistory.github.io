                    round the royal dwelling, shouting in very harsh voices many
                    songs and discourses in praise of the king, in the course of
                    which they call him lord of the sun and moon, king of the
                    land and of the rivers, conqueror of his enemies, great in
                    all things, great thief, great wizard, great lion; and all
                    other forms of greatness which they can invent, either good
                    or bad, are attributed to him by them.

                  <p>
                    When the king goes out he is surrounded and encircled by
                    these marombes, who recite these praises to him with loud
                    cries, to the sound of small drums, iron and bells, which
                    help them to make a louder noise and clamour.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Quiteve also makes use of another class of people, great
                    musicians and dancers, who have no other office than to sit
                    at the first room of the king's palace at the outer door,
                    and round his dwelling, playing many different musical
                    instruments and singing to them a great variety of songs and
                    discourses in praise of the king, in high and sonorous
                    voices.

                  We have the following account, written about the same time, of
                  the king Mwene Mutapa, from Joao de Barros:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    This king, whom we call Benomotapa or Monomotapa, is the
                    same as an emperor among us, for such according to them is
                    the significance of his name. His state does not consist of
                    great pomp, ornaments and furniture for the service of his
                    person, for the greatest ornaments in his house are cotton
                    cloths made in the country with much labour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They wait upon him upon their knees, with one to taste the
                    food, which is done, not before he eats it, but from what is
                    left. When he drinks and coughs, all those who are present
                    must cry out some good words in praise of the king; and
                    wherever it is heard, the cry is passed from one to the
                    other, so that all the town knows that the king is drinking
                    and coughing.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The Benomotapa has state music of their fashion, wherever he
                  may be, even in the open country under a tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dos Santos tells us that the courts of Mwene Mutapa and
                  Quiteve were very similar:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    They speak in metaphors with very just comparisons, used
                    most appropriately for their purpose and interest. The other
                    customs of this Mwene Mutapa, and of his wives, officers,
                    service, dealings and laws, as well as other details
                    touching government and mode of life, and his vassals, are
                    very similar. and almost exactly the same as what I have
                    related of Quiteve, king of Sofala.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Some 300 years later H. N Hemans wrote the following
                  description of the ritual surrounding Hwange, chief of the
                  Nanzva, an offshoot of the Changamire Rozvi.

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Another prerogative exercised by the king was the use of the
                    drum. Of these he had two, one a large one - which was
                    always kept in the town, and a smaller one which was carried
                    before him on his journeys. He also had musicians who played
                    the native piano,
                    <a href="./../../../../2007/06/13/mbira">imbila</a>, and the
                    one-stringed guitar, <em>dende</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When traveling, the king was carried by his captains in a
                    mashila, none of the common people being allowed to touch
                    his conveyance. The order of procession was roughly as
                    follows.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First came soldiers; following them came the drum carried on
                    a pole slung between two men, the hinder one of whom beat it
                    as they marched; then came the king in his mashila; in their
                    turn came the musicians, the armour-bearers, (who were
                    captains each in charge of a special weapon), relays of
                    captains for the mashila, women carrying the king's food,
                    drinks and clothes, the bearers of the captains'
                    impedimenta, and then more soldiers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Whenever the sound of the king's drum was heard, people from
                    the villages through or near which the procession passed
                    were supposed to leave their various occupations, and run
                    out to salute their ruler.

                  <p>
                    a great noise announced the approach of the Chief. A
                    picturesque procession came winding in and out through the
                    crags and boulders, and descended slowly towards us. First
                    ran a sort of herald, crying out, "Here comes M'tassa! -
                    Lord of the Sun and Moon! - The Dog that prowls by night! -
                    The Eater up of white men!"
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The writers mention a man who carried the chiefly emblem, "a
                  beautiful battle-axe, made of black polished wood, curiously
                  inlaid with brass", which the Chief refused to sell, as it was
                  part of the inheritance he would leave to his successor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The accounts give more prominence to music, dance and song
                  than to the verbal praises. This accords with the considerable
                  development of music and musical instruments among the Shona,
                  and the place that music, song and dance play in their lives.
                  It also accords with the kind of ritual with which modern
                  chiefs are welcomed when they visit villages under their
                  jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is jubilation expressed in whistling and shrill cries,
                  leaping with simulated stabbing and striking among the men,
                  the hurling of axes and spears into trees and on to the
                  ground, dancing to the rhythm of drums, and songs from groups
                  both old and young.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The young unmarried women of the village go backwards on their
                  knees before the chief, sweeping his path with their fingers.
                  Praises are uttered by the orators of the village community.
                  In such a context of ritual,
                  <em>kufarira mambo</em> (rejoicing over the chief), they are a
                  medley of clan praises which, in the case of chiefs, are
                  especially elaborate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is likely that the ritual which emerges on these occasions,
                  to greet the accession or the visit of a Shona chief, bears
                  some relation of continuity with that of the Rozvi kings. The
                  royal courts would have evoked replicas among the tributary
                  chiefs. This ceremonial appears to be different from that
                  which attended the Zulu kings in historic times. For one
                  thing, the Shona chiefs do not seem to have had an official
                  bard responsible for the composition and recitations of
                  chiefly praises. For another, the Shona poets do not appear to
                  have laid the same emphasis on warlike exploits that the Zulu
                  <em>izimbongi</em> did.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shona poets did produce heroic poetry in response to deeds of
                  valor, and certain heroes are remembered who fought bravely
                  for their clans. There was certainly warfare in Shona life.
                  Cross-raiding and wars were common. The 18th century
                  Portuguese documents stress the aggressive, military side of
                  the Rozvi. It may be that the Rozvi kings did inspire heroic
                  poetry similar to that of the Zulu kings, and that this
                  disappeared in their "refuge" period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Certainly in the 19th century the Shona are seen as excelling
                  rather in the arts of peace than those of war, and were in
                  this respect very different from the Ndebele.

                    The Mashonas are skilled smiths, and make excellent iron
                    assegais, battle-axes, and hoes. They play a musical
                    instrument like the marimba of West Africa: the Mashonaland

                    The Mashonas kill elephants either by hamstringing them when
                    they are asleep with a broad-bladed axe, or by stabbing them
                    between the shoulder-blades with a very heavy assegai from
                    an ambush in a tree.
