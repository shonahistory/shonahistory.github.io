                  Shona praise poetry is referred to in Shona as
                  <em>nhetembo dzemadzinza</em>, which means clan praise poetry.
                  In the Shona traditional context, it was the medium for
                  expressing genuine and heartfelt sentiments of appreciation,
                  homage and gratitude for any commendable action done by
                  someone to his relatives or even non-relatives. Generosity and
                  concern for others are celebrated virtues at the core of the
                  Shona philosophy of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, generous deeds always required sincere appreciation
                  and thanks. Such a belief is expressed in the Shona proverb,
                  <em>kusatenda uroyi</em>. Clan praise poetry derived its
                  praises from the attributes of an animal, object or organ of
                  an animal that is taken as totem by members of a particular
                  clan as well as from the attributes of the clan's ancestors.
                  It is for this reason why totemism is the basis of praise
                  poetry in Shona culture rather than the attributes of an
                  individual as in Nguni royal praises (<em>izibongo</em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  While in some Nguni cultures, praise poetry was more
                  formalised and recited to chiefs and kings at public
                  gatherings, in Shona culture its recitation was informal.
                  Every member of the clan across age and sex deserved praise
                  from the clan's poetic praises upon rendering some good
                  service. However, the praises of chiefs were done by close
                  relatives and friends particularly, the chief's nephew
                  (<em>dunzvi</em>) or the chief's friend (<em>sahwira</em>)
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>THE SOCIO-CULTURAL CONTEXT</strong><br />
                  The belief in totemism and recitation of clan praise poetry is
                  a tradition whose history dates back to the initial stages of
                  Shona culture. Shona verbal artistry evolved in tandem with
                  the culture that gave rise to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With particular reference to Shona praise poetry, its rhythm
                  echoes from the apex of Shona civilisation particularly in the
                  socio-cultural history of the ruling dynasties associated with
                  the Great Zimbabwe state (1250 - 1450), the Mutapa state (1450
                  - 1870s), the Torwa state (1450 - 1690s) and the Rozvi state
                  (1690s - 1830s).
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the bottom, it reverberated in every homestead, village and
                  chiefdom, making the entire Shona socio-cultural life a rhythm
                  of laudatory remarks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Praise poetry was part and parcel of the belief in and
                  celebration of totemism. In a typical traditional Shona life,
                  praise poetry graced daily life. No day would pass without it
                  being recited. It is not known exactly when totemism began in
                  Shona society. What is clear is that it was adopted in the
                  mythological times of Shona culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to Shona oral traditions, the adoption of totemism
                  is associated with the earliest known ancestor of the Shona
                  people, Mambiri. He chose the Soko totem to guard against
                  incestuous behavior (<em>makunakuna</em>) and also for the social identity of his
                  followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This took place in a mythical place called Guruuswa, which was
                  located somewhere north of the Zambezi River in southern
                  Tanganyika.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the early Shona grew in number and marriage became
                  difficult (due to the fact that they practiced the custom of
                  marrying only outside one's clan) there was need to adopt a
                  second totem. The <em>Shava/Mhofu</em> (Eland) totem was
                  therefore adopted so as to enable intermarriage between
                  members of the two totems to take place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contemporary Shona society there are at least 25
                  identifiable <em>mitupo</em> (totems) with at least 60
                  principal names (<em>zvidawo</em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Usually members of the clan are not allowed to eat the flesh
                  of the animal or at least there is a token taboo on some part
                  of the animal, such as the heart or trunk of an elephant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most Shona believe that to break this taboo would result in a
                  loss of teeth or some other harm; similar sanctions may
                  support a powerful oath made on the clan name; events
                  involving the animal concerned are sometimes interpreted as
                  signs from ancestral spirits; all of which suggest that the
                  mitupo and zvidao have religious and symbolic connotations
                  which make them more than simply names.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the mythical or religious significance of the clan emblem
                  should not be over-emphasized. Occasionally names have been
                  changed simply to conceal the identity of a group or to adjust
                  its relations with other groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The names are most commonly used in a respectful greeting or
                  when one wishes to show gratitude. In the country a wife may
                  praise her husband with his clan names when he presents her
                  with the spoils of a successful hunt; in the towns she may do
                  the same when her husband comes home with a week's provisions
                  after receiving his pay.

                  <strong>IMPORTANT FEATURES OF CLAN PRAISE POETRY</strong
                  ><br />
                  (a) <em>The Clan</em> - It is the core of every Shona
                  chiefdom. It is a group of related kinsmen who trace their
                  descent from a common founding ancestor. The founding ancestor
                  is called <em>sikarudzi</em>. In most clan praises the name of
                  the sikarudzi is constantly made reference to. For example, in
                  the praises of the people of the Soko totem, the names
                  <em>Tovela/Tobela</em> and <em>Mbire</em> are mentioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first was a name for the second known earliest ancestor of
                  the Shona people and the second is a name for the early Shona
                  people that is derived from Mambiri, the earliest known
                  ancestor of the same people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  (b) <em>The Totem</em> - Every Shona clan is identified by a
                  particular <em>mutupo</em> (totem) and
                  <em>chidawo</em> (principal praise name). The totem of each
                  clan was adopted by the founder of the clan and is therefore
                  supposed to be inherited by all his descendants, male and
                  female alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The principal praise name is used in addition to the totem if
                  there is need to distinguish people who have the same totem
                  but belong to different clans. For instance, there are many
                  Shona clans whose totem is Shava and these clans are
                  differentiated by citing the totem together with the praise
                  name. For instance,
                  <em>Shava-Museyamwa, Soko-Murehwa, Shumba-Nyamuziwa</em> and
                  so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  (c) <em>The Chief</em> &#8211; He is referred to as
                  <em>ishe</em> or <em>mambo</em> and he is a living senior
                  member of the clan. He is the guardian of the clan's
                  traditions and customs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>THE REFERENCE OF CLAN PRAISE POETRY</strong><br />
                  First and foremost the praises of the clan are phrases in
                  terms of the totem. For instance, the praises of the clans
                  whose totems are Soko (monkey), Tembo (zebra) and Nzou
                  (elephant) are characterised by imagery that is directly
                  implied by these animals. Thus we have such praises as
                  <em>soko makwiramiti</em>,
                  <em>mbizi njuma yerenje</em> (zebra, the hornless beast) and
                  <em>nzou samanyanga</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the praises of other clans whose totems are not
                  animals but organs of human beings or animals, such as Moyo
                  and Tsiwo (male genitalia) are differently inspired. The
                  imagery of the Moyo totem is derived from the heart while that
                  of the Tsiwo is allusive of the male genitalia and its field
                  of operation, the female genitalia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Secondly, clan praises are based on ancestral references;
                  names of forefathers of the clan, their sisters including the
                  names of placed they once lived in and were buried.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such places record milestones in the history of the clan and
                  remain culturally and historically symbolic to the clan. In
                  short they were part of the clan's non-tangible heritage.
                  Reference to ancestors when thanking someone meant that
                  actually it was his/her lineage that was thanked. The person
                  only represented the clan in extending its good deeds.
