                  At some stage, variously estimated as being within the period
                  from the 9th to the 14th centuries, a greater political
                  cohesion developed on the foundations of the gold trade with
                  the coast. For the first time African society knew wealth, in
                  the accepted sense of the word.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Where there is wealth men will always try to control it. At
                  Zimbabwe and no doubt at other centres there developed a
                  ruling class, the main features of which we can describe. In
                  the middle of the 15th century an upheaval took place which
                  saw this ruling class split into two main dynasties, those of
                  the Mwene Mutapa and the Rozvi under their leader Changamire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The founder of the Mwene Mutapa dynasty, Mutota, voluntarily
                  left the Masvingo capital for the Zambezi Valley, in search of
                  salt, and because of their superior civilisation they found it
                  easy to subjugate the still primitive and disorganised
                  communities in the Zambezi Valley.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There some sort of empire was set up but it was a faint shadow
                  of the state held at the Masvingo Zimbabwe which now entered
                  its heyday under undisputed Rozvi leadership. The Portuguese
                  encountered the Mwene Mutapa kings at the height of their
                  power when they were a force to be reckoned with almost as far
                  as the coast, but almost from the outset these lesser tribes
                  struggled to regain their independence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Portuguese arrived at a critical time. They didn't succeed
                  in making contact with the Rozvi kingdom in the south until
                  very much later and even then on the most tentative basis. It
                  was in the southern kingdom that most of the real gold wealth
                  lay, although by now this was beginning to fail.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, local consumption of gold was on the increase.
                  The Portuguese were disappointed in the volume of the gold
                  trade and their own explanation, namely of warfare in the
                  interior, was probably not far short of the truth. It is
                  hardly likely that the rural chiefs and headmen of the Mwene
                  Mutapa would have passed on Portuguese traders and explorers
                  to their rivals and enemies in the vast kingdom they knew as
                  Butua, the Rozvi sphere of influence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet trade there undoubtedly was for this period in Zimbabwe's
                  history was the richest in trade goods of all kinds. The main
                  Rozvi trade contacts were probably with Arabs who certainly
                  continued in great numbers in both courts up to the time of
                  the death of the Jesuit priest, Father da Silveira, who was
                  executed on the orders of the Mwene Mutapa Negomo in 1561.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From that time onwards the Mwene Mutapa empire went into a
                  decline and with it, incidentally, the Portuguese, who seemed
                  to have left, of all the invading races, almost no permanent
                  mark upon the people as such, although of course their
                  influence closer to the coast has been pronounced throughout
                  the period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the subsequent fortunes of the Mwene Mutapa are well
                  known, the detailed history of the Rozvi hegemony is
                  correspondingly obscure. A Rozvi ruling class, manifested
                  through a large clan with mutupo <em>Moyo</em>, meaning
                  "heart", was not incompatible with the local autonomy of
                  numerous other clans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rozvi overlordship carried with it some Rozvi influence in the
                  succession of these local rulers to the chieftaincies, and
                  probably the payment of tribute, though in what form precisely
                  we do not know. Rozvi control was to a large extent exercised
                  through the religious system which is so closely associated
                  with their ruling class. Some description of this is necessary
                  as religion is one of the most persistent features in African
                  culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Zimbabwe was a religious centre. Even Carl Mauch who visited
                  Zimbabwe as late as 1872, long after the Rozvi had departed
                  from that centre and their power had been broken by successive
                  Nguni invasions, was able to meet people who could give him
                  elaborate descriptions of rituals which had taken place there
                  during their lifetimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whether the Rozvi introduced the cult of Mwari or not we do
                  not know. Today, as it was in the past, the high priests of
                  the Mwari cult at its principal shrine in the Matopos where it
                  was transferred from Zimbabwe possibly even before that
                  capital was raided by Zwangendaba, are not Rozvi, but people
                  of a different Shona tribe, the Mbire with the Mutupo Shoko.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is by no means unlikely that the Rozvi took over and
                  adapted a pre-existing religious cult in much the same way
                  that the Ndebele tolerated the cult of Mwari in the Matopos,
                  whom they honoured under the name Mlimo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Mwari cult, as it is organised now, and as it appears to
                  have been organised in the past, is oracular in nature. The
                  god speaks through a mouth, and the other high officials are
                  known as the ear and the eye. This latter post was always held
                  by a Murozvi and it is believed that in this way the Rozvi
                  maintained a secret intelligence service which covered the
                  whole of their kingdom under the cloak of the priesthood, as
                  it was the duty of the eye to gather information which would
                  then be reported to the cult headquarters.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An equally important element in Shona religion is the system
                  of ancestral spirits of great historic personages who fulfil a
                  tutelary function and are brought into contact with the living
                  through means of spirit mediums (swikiros) also known as
                  mhondoros.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is some dispute as to whether the cult of Mwari and the
                  system of tutelary spirits are complementary or whether they
                  are two entirely separate conceptions of the supernatural
                  which, at some point, overlapped or which had been
                  syncretised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Certain it is that the cult of spirit mediums is more firmly
                  entrenched as a separate and distinct entity in northern
                  Mashonaland, the area of the old Mwene Mutapa empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But to return to the Rozvi, to this day they are everywhere
                  said to have known God and they formed a multitude of the
                  children of God who traveled about the country as religious
                  companies, claiming certain rights and privileges from all who
                  met them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mwari is also a god of fertility and rainfall, and undoubtedly
                  a great part of the power of the cult and, therefore, of its
                  Rozvi masters lay in the power of Mwari to bless or curse the
                  land and crops. There was a strong mystical connection between
                  the fertility of the land and the Rozvi king who had many of
                  the attributes of the so-called sacred king.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In particular, there are traditions too numerous to disregard
                  that the king was killed when his sexual power began to wane,
                  lest his impotence render the land infertile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the eve of the Nguni invasions, therefore, we are to
                  imagine a relatively peaceful and stable society in the
                  central and southern parts of the country, dominated, but not
                  oppressively so, by the Rozvi ruling class who had by this
                  time established a number of subsidiary provincial capitals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Rozvi court was one of considerable sophistication with a
                  love of ostentation which is clearly evidenced by the later
                  buildings they erected. The common people lived a life that
                  cannot have been greatly different from that they followed at
                  the time the Europeans first arrived here and described it,
                  that is to say, in villages based on the extended family,
                  pursuing a simple agricultural and pastoral existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were very limited economic specialisations in these
                  communities, some iron-making and possibly cloth-making in
                  some parts from wild cotton, with the manufacture of domestic
                  pottery a widespread women's chore. Hunting of game was widely
                  practised, and it is evident that, here too, there was some
                  degree of specialisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most of the gold mines were worked out before the Nguni
                  invasions, but it is probable that some mines continued
                  production in all areas right up to the end. A glimpse of this
                  society through the eyes of one of its destroyers is
                  revealing, and I would like to quote a memory of an old
                  survivor, an old soldier of one of Zwangendaba's people who
                  came up and smashed the power of the Mambo.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Of all the countries we passed through, there was one that
                    struck us as most desirable. This was a country in which a
                    people called the Abalozwi lived. They built their villages
                    on granite hills which they fortified with stone walls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their Chief, Mambo, put up a stubborn fight and then fled
                    into the very hilly granite country, making it difficult for
                    us to subdue him. Zwangendaba and his men then laid siege to
                    this place which was the hill we call today Ntaba zi ka
                    mambo but which was known in those days as Nyanganga hill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They gave us beads and skins and hoes and offered us cattle
                    and sheep to go away and leave them in peace but we were not
                    to be propitiated. Next day they came out again from the
                    rocks and directed us to stand below a certain strange
                    overhanging rock; it looked like a big balcony giving
                    standing room to about 200 men.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thereon were gathered the Mambo and his counsellors
                    jabbering and chattering like a lot of monkeys; this rock
                    stands about 100 feet above where we were standing with a
                    sheer drop and it is here that the Mambo threw himself down
                    in our midst to fall dead and mangled at our feet.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Now, it is curious the element of scorn that there is in this
                  interpretation; that the very sophisticated nature of the
                  Rozvi court was something quite unintelligible to their
                  destroyers. They just appeared to them as a parcel of monkeys
                  chattering and jabbering and yet there is no doubt that it was
                  a moment of intention, intense emotion and probably ritual, up
                  on that rock.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The exact pattern of Zwangendaba's raiding is not known, but
                  he destroyed every Rozvi centre of power. This took place
                  about 1834. Within five years of the departure ot the Swazi
                  the Ndebele had arrived and completed the destruction of the
                  Rozvi rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ndebele were something more than a tribe; they were a
                  nation founded on military and caste principles. They had come
                  up the hard way, having to fight themselves clear not only of
                  Shaka but also of the Boers in the Transvaal. When they
                  arrived in the country they were, quite simply, predators.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet very few people now doubt that the tales of their
                  depredations have been somewhat exaggerated, not least by
                  Chartered Company minions who were concerned to prove that
                  Lobengula's dominion extended over the whole country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was quite certainly untrue. There were very considerable
                  areas where the Ndebele had never raided, notably throughout
                  northern Mashonaland and in the eastern parts. After a
                  relatively short space of time in which they had made
                  themselves a name to be feared by the arbitrary nature of
                  their acts of cruelty, the Ndebele settled down to a system of
                  milking those Shona communities which recognised their
                  paramountcy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Carl Mauch, who had very good personal reasons to avoid the
                  Ndebele, describes one such visit while he was living near the
                  Duma people in the Zimbabwe ruins. There is no doubt that this
                  visitation was dreaded by the locals, who took precautions
                  against being despoiled, but there is something of an
                  anticlimax in Mauch's account when the warriors sit down to
                  discuss the vagaries of Matabeleland weather, evidently much
                  the same then as it is today, and petty politics, before
                  asking for a guide to take them on to the next kraal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Still, the violent nature of the Ndebele occupation should not
                  be minimised. The Ndebele left the political system of the
                  Shona largely intact, apart from ensuring that the Rozvi never
                  again regained their ascendancy by, inter alia, killing off
                  the most important of the Rozvi spirit mediums, the svikiro of
                  Chaminuka.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Rozvi cult of Mwari, however, had already moved to the
                  Matopos where it accommodated itself to its new masters.
                  Another feature of the Ndebele system was the incorporation of
                  subject elements into the nation. Cattle were not all that the
                  Ndebele raided; they would take women and children too, the
                  latter to build new regiments of warriors which formed an
                  integral part of their nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a very understandable manner these people, the ones that
                  were incorporated, enthusiastically adopted the culture of
                  their new masters, taking their language, Ndebele-ising their
                  names and generally becoming more Ndebele than the Ndebele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>ECONOMY, CULTURE AND DECLINE</strong><br />
                  The Rozvi chiefs revived the tradition of building in stone
                  and constructed impressive cities throughout the southwest.
                  Polychrome pottery was also emblematic of its culture. The
                  economic power of the Rozvi Empire was based on cattle wealth
                  and farming with significant gold mining continued.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trade was established with Arab traders where metals such as
                  gold and copper and ivory were exchanged for luxury goods.
                  Records from the Portuguese account have shown that the Rozvi
                  were expert military strategists and that they had used the
                  cow-horn formation years before the great Zulu leader Shaka
                  had. Without the use of guns and cannons, but spears and bows
                  and arrows, the aggressive Rozvi took over the plateau.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Rozvi, unlike the Mutapa, did not much rely on the
                  intervention of spirit mediums to decide the monarch, but
                  rather wealth and acclaim or, in many cases, succession. This
                  system caused problems, as some people disagreed with the
                  successors and after nearly two hundred years of total rule
                  over the region, the empire was starting to decline.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the 1790s the whole southern African region began to
                  experience a prolonged series of droughts. They weakened the
                  Rozvi Empire, which allowed local chiefs and spirit mediums to
                  begin seizing power. The gold fairs functioned only
                  intermittently. Internal feuding also weakened the empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the early 19th century, the period of regional warfare and
                  forced migrations known as the <em>mfecane</em> began.
                  Following victories by the Zulu king Shaka, the Ndwandwe, a
                  Nguni-speaking people, were forcibly dispersed, and armed
                  bands led by Ndebele chiefs migrated northward, invading the
                  Rozvi Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The empire was devastated by the Ndwandwe armies of Nxaba and
                  Zwangendaba. In the early 1830s the last Rozvi ruler was
                  killed in his capital of Khame. Zimbabwe came under control of
                  Ndebele chief Lobengula in 1834.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, the Rozvi descendants are those of the family
                  Moyondizvo. Among the Moyondizvo family there are families
                  like Mutendi,

                  <strong>ORAL TRADITIONS</strong><br />
                  The canvas of history can be painted in bold strokes without
                  concern for accuracy of details. I will recall two legends and
                  may draw on others less widely known to construct the possible
                  sweep of history from the early birth of the Karanga or Proto
                  Shona polities until the final disintegration of the
                  Monomatapa influence of recent times.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first of these legends was told to me by a very senior
                  <em>jinda</em> (prince) of the VaRozvi clan. He had certain
                  justification in asserting that he was amongst the few who
                  could lay claim to the title Mambo or king.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our forefathers lived in a place called Samangai, which is a
                  very old town beyond the seas. There came a time when the
                  people became many and their king, Mambo Sororezhou, declared
                  that they must depart from Samangai. He said "Oh! this nation
                  (rudzi) is big. It is better that we cross the water".
                </p>
                <p>
                  So they built their boats and they made big torches; they put
                  stones and sand in the bottom of the boats on which they
                  placed their fire, their torches, and then they entered into
                  the boats.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They made fire for sacrifices (<em>moto unopira</em>) so that
                  they could be carried safely across the water by their god,
                  Mwari. At that time Sororezhou had many people with him,
                  included amongst these was Chigwangu who was a priest or
                  wizard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were many other <em>machinda</em> (royal princes), as
                  well as <em>makota</em> (councillors, or ministers of state).
                  Now they left and crossed the sea sailing across the ocean to
                  the south until they came to land at the mouth of a great
                  river. Here they landed and left their boats. Together they
                  all traveled until they came to Giri mountain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here they stopped and there was consultation amongst the
                  leaders. Chigwangu said; "We cannot stay together now that we
                  have discovered this great land, I propose to move northwards
                  following the coast." Sororezhou said: "I will go to the
                  hinterland".
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sororezhou traveled on and reached the hill of Rukungubwe
                  where they settled and built edifices of stone. After some
                  time Mwari spoke to them and told them to move again as this
                  was not the place. So Sororezhou moved on with his followers
                  leaving others behind who became his children, the Bavenda,
                  and came at last to Zimbabwe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And there they settled for a long time and from time to time
                  they would receive visits from the others (i.e. Bavenda) and
                  they would slaughter cattle to sacrifice to Mwari and to
                  celebrate the coming from their original place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually their Voice (<em>Hwi Ravo</em>) spoke to them and
                  said "Leave here! this is not where I want you to stay!" So
                  they left and went to the area of Mabwemachena (the Matopos).
                </p>
                <p>
                  They stayed at the Matopos and built other stone buildings.
                  And here too they tamed cattle and sacrificed them to the
                  Njerere (sparrow hawk).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second is the legend of Mutota and his migration from the
                  south.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mutota, the first Monomatapa recorded in oral tradition, was
                  the son or grandson of one Chibatamatosi who is said to have
                  been part of the original Rozvi/Karanga migration. He is said
                  to have resided in the legendary land of Guruuswa (Big Grass).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Guruuswa is the name of the country claimed by people in
                  Northern and Central Mashonaland to be the original home of
                  their ancestors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is related that Mutota grew tired of the continuous lack of
                  salt in Guruuswa. He sent his <em>munyai</em> (emissary)
                  Nyakutonje, on an expedition to the north to find the salt
                  pans of the Zambezi valley.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nyakutonje is reported to have brought back news that he had
                  found the salt pans and that the tribe need no longer continue
                  extracting salt from the ashes of goat's dung.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Mutota migration to the valley commenced in order to
                  settle the tribe near these salt pans. However, Mutota never
                  reached the promised land. He died in the neighbourhood of the
                  Musengezi River and was buried at <em>Tuuyu Tusere</em> (the
                  place of the Eight Small Baobab Trees).
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was common practice in those days, and until fairly
                  recently in some places, for successors to the great
                  chieftainships to fortify their installation by the practice
                  of ritual incest with a sister. This was known as the
                  <em>kupinga pasi</em> ceremony.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was necessary with Mutota's death, but at first none of
                  his brothers or sons could bring themselves to perform such an
                  unnatural act.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally Nobedza agreed to do this and he was given his sister
                  Nehanda in ritual marriage. After performing the task Nehanda
                  was so disgusted with herself she disappeared with her
                  followers into a rock which is to this day known as
                  <em>Gumbi raNehanda</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nehanda has subsequently become the great ambuya of the
                  Northern Shona people. The subsequent history of the Mutota
                  people, the Munhumutapas of history, is the subjugation of
                  various neighboring tribes, the settling of migrant groups and
                  the allocation of districts to minor chieftainships.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With few exceptions all chieftainships in the Mount Darwin and
                  Sipolilo districts and some in Bindura and Shamva and as far
                  south as Mazowe were finally allocated their areas by the
                  Munhumutapa, Mukombwe, perhaps the last of the great
                  Munhumutapas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He was known as Goveranyika, which means "to divide or create
                  the boundaries of the country". If one considers the primitive
                  form of administration, of communication and relates this to
                  the size of the area which fell under the sway of the
                  Munhumutapas, one must marvel how they managed to hold
                  together the people in such a large area.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another version of the Mutota migration comes from Sipolilo.
                  It says that Mutota came from Mbire which they identify with
                  the area around Hwedza and Marondera. Nyakutonje had
                  discovered salt and he took some of this to Guruuswa where he
                  encountered Mutota and his friend Chinguwo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Motota offered Nyakutonje
                  <a href="../../../../2014/02/16/sadza-ne-nyama">sadza</a> to
                  eat and in return the latter offered salt to mix with the
                  food. Mutota so liked the taste that he exclaimed "This
                  servant shall not be allowed to go away: the spirits of our
                  forefathers have blessed us!".
                </p>
                <p>
                  He enquired of Nyakutonje from whence he had come and where he
                  had acquired the salt. Nyakutonje agreed to lead them to the
                  area. At first the party settled at Mount Hwedza. Later they
                  moved on to Harare, then through the Mazowe Valley. Some
                  families grew tired along the route and remained in the Mazowe
                  Valley area.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later a stop was made at the Mvurwi Mountains (The Great
                  Dyke), where a meeting was held. At this meeting a decision
                  was made as to the direction in which the various groups
                  should go.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mutota followed Nyakutonje northwards while Chinguwo proceeded
                  westwards to the country known as Guruve. Mutota's intention
                  was to make miracles and take over control of the Dande.
                </p>
                <p>He said to Nyakutonje</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    When we are near the Dande and before we reach the crest of
                    the hill I require you to tell me so that I will be able to
                    prepare my magic

                  Nyakutonje did not obey these instructions and when they
                  reached the Chitako Hills they climbed to the top and Mutota
                  was shown the flat country of the Dande. As a result his
                  miracles failed because he had seen the country with his eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mutota was disappointed. He held back and built his home at
                  Gomwe Hill. Later Mutota's people brought eight baobab trees
                  from the Dande and planted them at the village.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to this legend the successor to Mutota was Nobedza.
                  Mutota also had a daughter by the name of Nyamhita. Nobedza
                  was followed by Nyahuma who was followed by Chikunu who was
                  followed by Chimvere who was followed by Mavura who was
                  followed by Mukombwe (Goveranyika), who was followed by
                  Chirwuriyanga who was followed by Chiwawa who was followed by
                  Nyamushanga who was followed by Virimba.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon Virimba's death his sons Muzarabani and Chitsungo founded
                  their own chieftainships. At that time the empire was in
                  decay.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Further tradition in the Muzarabani area relates that Nyamhita
                  was made princess of the district of Handa. As princess of
                  Handa she acquired the title of Nehanda. As such she is
                  venerated as the great female ancestral spirit of all the
                  Korekore speaking people and the Tavara clans, and in fact
                  southwards taking in a large number of the Zezuru people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She is one of the great mhondoro and rain petitioning spirits.
                  Nehanda was childless and after the ritual incest she was so
                  disgusted with herself that she retired to her country and
                  disappeared into a small hill. Rain ceremonies are performed
                  there to this day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is interesting to note that there are other areas which
                  also claim to have mediums who represent Nehanda. This is
                  because a further legend states that after the ceremony she
                  did not completely disappear, but rather cut all ties with her
                  relations in the Dande and returned to the south.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She did not stay with the VaRozvi but settled with the
                  VaGumbo, the Gutu people who at that stage lived near
                  Domboshawa. This later became Chief Hwata's country and there
                  to this day, near Christon Bank, she is petitioned each year
                  at the shrines of Shavarunzvi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is noteworthy that the medium of Nehanda of the Hwata area
                  played an important part in the
                  <a href="../../../../2009/07/28/the-1896-97-war"
                    >Shona War of Resistance</a
                  >
                  of 1896.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She was executed at Salisbury prison on the 27th April, 1898.
                  Kaguvi and eleven other men were also executed. The men all
                  died quietly, having been baptised by Father Richards of
                  Chishawasha mission, with the exception of Nehanda's medium
                  who was the only woman condemned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She refused to listen to the priest and danced and laughed,
                  shouting hysterically before the execution. She called for her
                  people and wanted to return to her country near the Mazowe and
                  die there. She resisted to the last and had to be carried up
                  to the scaffold.

                  She has subsequently become a greatly revered figure amongst
                  the Shona people and is regarded by them as a martyr and
                  national figure of resistance.

                    In some cases, the reputation of the spirit depends almost
                    entirely on the medium. In central Shona country, knowledge
                    of ancient and "forgotten" makombwe (lion spirits) depends
                    on what their possessed mediums do and say, and the
                    activities of the historical persons become confused with
                    the activities of famous mediums.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thus the most famous spirit in central Shona country is
                    Chaminuka, renowned as a rain-maker who is beseeched in rain
                    rituals in widely dispersed localities. When asked about the
                    history of Chaminuka, people readily tell the story of how
                    he was captured by the Ndebele and killed at the orders of
                    Lobengula. Few people seem aware that the man killed by the
                    Ndebele was in fact an influential medium of Chaminuka.

                  Legend about the subsequent Munuhumutapas as mentioned earlier
                  is not comprehensive. Traditions such as they exist refer to
                  individual clan relationships with the reigning monarch who is
                  generally referred to by the generic title of Mutota.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other legends refer to the conquest of new areas and peoples
                  such as the subjugation of the VaTawara along the Mukumbura in
                  the area of Choma where by the use of magic the cult centre of
                  Dzivaguru was finally absorbed, the stories of other clans
                  migrating into the area from the southeast such as Dotito in
                  Mount Darwin and Chimanda in the present day Rushinga
                  district.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the area legend substantiates the hypothesis that
                  there was constant jostling for position and frequent
                  skirmishes between the various chieftainships which comprised
                  the overall empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dynastic disputes were common and it is undoubtedly the result
                  of these internecine feuds, coupled with the lack of speedy
                  communication and the written word, which led to the final
                  decay of the once flourishing empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Legend has it that the last of the Munuhumutapas lived north
                  of Mukumbura in a state of abject poverty and controlled
                  little more than his own village.
