                  In 1838 when the Ndebele first entered the country, they found
                  a collection of tribes inhabiting the country living under
                  conditions not dissimilar from their own. These tribes
                  comprised the Makorekore, Makaranga, Manyika, VaHera, Rozvi,
                  Bavenda, VaZezuru and many others, all of whom today are
                  designated the "Mashona".
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The origin of the name <em>Shona</em> is uncertain. It
                    appears to have been used first by the Ndebele as a
                    derogatory name for the people they had defeated, and
                    particularly the Rozvi. It is thought to have come from the
                    word <em>ukutshona</em> â€” to sink or go down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Shona did not call themselves by this name and at first
                    disliked it; even now they tend rather to classify
                    themselves by their dialect groups (Karanga, Manyika,
                    Zezuru, Korekore, etc.), though most accept the designation
                    Shona in contrast to unrelated peoples.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Shona were never integrated into a single nation, so the
                    extension of the term to all the tribes appears to have been
                    a colonial innovation.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The currently accepted classification of Shona peoples into
                  the main dialect groups is the result of a linguistic study on
                  the possibility of developing a unified language from the
                  various dialects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The conclusion of the study was that the dialects spoken by
                  the Zezuru in central Shona country, the Korekore in the
                  north, the Karanga and the Kalanga in the south and the
                  Manyika and Ndau in the east are all classifiable as a single
                  linguistic unit: these together with the Barwe-Tonga comprise
                  the peoples at whom we have been looking and whose histories
                  are so interrelated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Zezuru, the Korekore, the Karanga and the Manyika all
                  speak dialects which can readily be incorporated into a
                  unified language based on the Zezuru dialect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The language of the Ndau peoples is more distinct due possibly
                  to the influence of the Shangaan invaders, and the Kalanga
                  dialect is quite different from the other Shona dialects due
                  no doubt to centuries of separation reinforced by the more
                  recent Ndebele settlement between them and the rest of the
                  Shona peoples.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although these classifications are linguistic, and although
                  the boundaries of the groups classified in this way are not
                  precise, they do reflect the cultural patterns of the Shona
                  peoples and also to some extent their various histories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Zezuru peoples of central Shona country comprise a number
                  of independent chiefdoms, united by geographical propinquity,
                  by their common language and culture and also by some of the
                  greater religious cults which spread their influence beyond
                  the boundaries of particular chiefdoms: The current chiefdoms,
                  however, result from numerous migrations over the past few
                  centuries and the Zezuru peoples do not have a common history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the largest city is situated in the heart of Zezuru
                  country, industrialization has affected the Zezuru peoples
                  more than peoples in remoter parts of the country, and the
                  central Zezuru are on the whole materially more progressive
                  than surrounding peoples.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This has given a certain standing to peoples classified as
                  Zezuru and, especially where the Zezuru and the Korekore meet,
                  peoples traditionally associated with the Korekore may prefer
                  to call themselves Zezuru.

                    The Jerusarema dance is a popular dance style practiced by
                    the Zezuru people. The dance is characterized by sensual and
                    acrobatic movements by women in unison with men. This
                    ancient fertility dance is also called "mbende", the Shona
                    word for mole, which was regarded as a symbol of fertility,
                    sexuality and family.

                <p>
                  To the north are the Korekore people, descended from the
                  subject chiefdoms of the Mutapas, together with a few more
                  recently settled chiefdoms. To the north-east of them are the
                  Tavara peoples, who were also once incorporated into the
                  Mutapa State.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Tavara were originally the autochthonous people who lived
                  in the Zambezi Valley before the Korekore came down from the
                  plateau, but now the division between Korekore and Tavara
                  corresponds roughly with the boundary between Zimbabwe and
                  Mozambique.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is little cultural difference between the Korekore and
                  the Zezuru, though the Tavara and some others of the valley
                  peoples have a distinctive kinship system which gives less
                  emphasis to the male line than do other Shona systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the south are the Karanga peoples, occupying the area
                  covered by the ancient Zimbabwe State. The contemporary
                  chiefdoms, however, are largely the result of migrations in
                  the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. In their religious cults
                  and in the way they elect a new chief, there is no doubt that
                  their culture is basically similar to that of the Korekore and
                  Zezuru.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also similar are the Manyika, to the east of Zezuru country,
                  who have distinctive features in their public rituals and in
                  their patterns on kinship. Originally the name Manyika applied
                  only to the people around what is now Mutare, and the
                  extension of the name to neighboring peoples occurred through
                  the influence of missionary activity and white government
                  administration in the twentieth century. The extension of the
                  name is now accepted by the people themselves, who thereby
                  acknowledge a certain unity between the chiefdoms so
                  designated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ndau peoples to the south-east, some of whom are in
                  Zimbabwe, show marked differences from other Shona groups in
                  their language, in their politico-religious structure, and no
                  doubt in other ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, they do have Shona origins, and they are rightly
                  still classified as Shona. The same applies to the Kalanga,
                  who live in the southwest of Zimbabwe and stretch into
                  neighboring Botswana, and who in some ways align themselves
                  with the Ndebele rather than with the Shona.

                  <p>
                    Also of interest was a group of enterprising iron workers,
                    the Njanja, who smelted the high class ore from Wedza
                    mountain and traded their products widely in Shona country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their superior techniques of smelting and working iron
                    produced high quality goods which were valued among
                    surrounding peoples. Neighboring peoples preferred Njanja
                    hoes to the local products of inferior iron.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Especially prized were Njanja
                    <a href="../../../../2007/06/13/mbira/">mbira,</a>, musical
                    instruments comprising perhaps thirty finely tuned iron
                    reeds set on a resonant wooden base and requiring good
                    quality metal and skilled workmanship.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They traded their iron products for cattle and other
                    livestock in areas a couple of hundred kilometers from their
                    home. Their wealth from trade allowed expert smelters and
                    smiths to gather growing communities of apprentices and
                    dependents, who in turn could perform the communal labour
                    necessary for smelting on a large scale.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although militarily they were weak (they never succeeded in
                    taking the mountain which was the source of their ore), they
                    were able to acquire, through trade, wealth in cattle and
                    other livestock.

                <p>
                  Prior to the invasion of the Nguni, the
                  <a href="../../../../2007/06/13/the-rozvi-empire/">Rozvi</a>
                  were once recognised as a paramount power in the land (their
                  rulers being known as <em>Mambo</em>), but they held only a
                  loose form of control over tributary tribes, who themselves
                  exercised self rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This titular control was based on the
                  <a href="../../../../2014/07/26/mwari">Mwari</a> cult. The
                  Rozvi emissaries claimed they knew God, that is Mwari, and
                  called themselves the children of God. The election to
                  chieftainship in each tribe was, for example, one of the
                  matters which required the approval of the Mambo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona tribal system lacked the vigour of the Ndebele, due
                  to there being no central authority. Strict military
                  discipline, which was prominent in the despotism of the
                  latter, was absent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a chief were of a strong character, intent upon improving
                  and maintaining discipline, he would most likely have been
                  forsaken by those of his people who desired a more congenial
                  life.

                    extinction that has befallen their neighbors and cousins,
                    the Banyai and Makalaka; but they have been so greatly
                    reduced, that, though they occupy 100,000 square miles of

                    The Mashonas are peaceful and industrious; they are
                    laborious agriculturalists, and raise large crops of grain,
                    including maize and rice. They keep herds of small cattle,

                  <strong>BECOMING URBAN, THE ATTRACTION OF TOWN LIFE</strong
                  ><br />
                  Increasing numbers of Shona are moving into the towns and
                  cities, many on a permanent basis. In the black townships of
                  the cities and towns in Shona country, different peoples from
                  inside and outside of the country gather together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, the Shona are by far the most numerous and the
                  Shona language is widely spoken â€” or rather
                  <em>chitaundi</em>, the language of town, which is basically
                  the Shona language with the addition of a large extraneous
                  vocabulary taken from English and other tongues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Chitaundi" can refer to the culture and customs of the towns
                  as well as to language. The language, which is clearly Shona
                  in structure and style though half the words may be English,
                  typifies the many changes that have taken place as Shona
                  culture adapts itself to town life: new institutions and new
                  ways of life fit themselves into the older social patterns,
                  with which the new town dwellers are familiar and which they
                  adapt appropriately to produce a culture which is neither
                  western nor traditionally Shona.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Electricity in most town homes provides lighting late into the
                  night and heat for warmth in the winter and sometimes for
                  cooking. Paraffin and electric stoves are easier to cook on
                  than wood fires, and do not fill the room with the unpleasant
                  wood smoke that commonly fills rural kitchens â€” or any rural
                  room in the winter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Running water to most homes obviates the necessity of women
                  fetching water from some distant supply and allows more
                  convenient washing facilities than are available in most rural
                  homes. Brick houses with corrugated iron roofs are proof
                  against rain, wind and dust, and are more readily defended
                  against bats, mice and other creatures, all of which can make
                  life very uncomfortable in traditional rural huts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is true that some town dwellers can find accommodation only
                  in rough shacks made from plastic and cardboard and corrugated
                  iron fixed onto a rough wood framework, but these are a
                  minority and they normally aspire to the better style of
                  dwelling that they see about them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Access to monetary incomes and close contact with markets
                  allow for furniture that provides some comfort and a smart
                  appearance to a town home, and for radios and gramophones for
                  entertainment.
                </p>
                <figure class="size-full">
                  <img loading="lazy" src="tv.webp" alt="TV" />
                </figure>
                <p>
                  In the towns people dress as smartly as they can according to
                  their incomes and occupations. Most people have fixed hours of
                  work during the day and fixed times for relaxation, when they
                  can drink at beer halls or shebeens and enjoy cinemas,
                  night-clubs, and football and racing at weekends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All this contrasts sharply with the rural areas where families
                  survive on their own with a minimum of outside help or
                  interference and a minimum of expense. Many inhabitants of the
                  towns have been born and brought up in an urban environment
                  and many others have spent over half their lives in the towns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is hard for these to give up the comforts of town life to
                  revert to the more primitive rural life, and few have any
                  intention of doing so if they can possibly avoid it. Some have
                  no real ties with rural relations and would find it impossible
                  to find a rural home even if they wished to.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They are town or city people who would find themselves at a
                  loss in the country: town is their home and they have no
                  other. Nevertheless, there are a number of difficulties in
                  living permanently in the towns, particularly those concerned
                  with the lack of social security.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since accommodation in towns cannot be based on patterns of
                  kinship, people tend to live away from close kin, and may have
                  no one on whom they can rely should they fall sick or find
                  themselves unemployed or when they grow old; and those
                  relatives who may wish to help are likely to find themselves
                  barely able financially to support their wives and children,
                  let alone other kin in need of sustenance, which is ever more
                  expensive in the towns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the rural areas, one can always find some food from a plot
                  of land; not enough to keep healthy, perhaps, but at least
                  enough to keep alive. In the towns everything costs money:
                  food, accommodation, entertainment, all of which can be had
                  relatively cheaply or for nothing in the rural areas, even
                  though there the quality may be inferior.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Accommodation in the towns is particularly problematic. Many
                  town dwellers lodge in hostels or illegally in the homes of
                  others, neither of which is satisfactory on a permanent basis.
                  Others live in houses owned, or at least supplied, by
                  employers and they have to move when they lose their
                  employment, be it through old age or for any other reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of those who rent their own accommodation few receive pensions
                  in old age adequate to meet this cost and few earn salaries
                  sufficiently large to enable them to save for old age or other
                  times of need. Some own their urban homes which they have
                  built for themselves, but there are still rates to pay and
                  people believe they can be, and are likely to be, evicted for
                  any of numerous minor offenses: although they are not entirely
                  justified in this belief, only a few of the wealthiest black
                  people have freehold rights to property in the townships.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Until independence, township residents generally felt
                  themselves to be completely at the mercy of their white
                  rulers, and since the establishment of black government in the
                  administration of townships is changing but slowly. So a home
                  in an urban area rarely provides the householder with a sense
                  of security.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then there is the need for physical care in old age. Since
                  social services are not adequate to care for all the urban
                  aged, they must rely on kin, who in the urban situation rarely
                  have room in their cramped housing to take in any extra
                  persons, and who are usually financially unable to support
                  aged parents or relatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is often difficult for adult children even to visit aged
                  relatives to do their chores: the aged are concentrated in the
                  oldest townships, while married sons and daughters have had to
                  take accommodation in the newer townships, many miles from the
                  homes of their parents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes a married son occupies the house of his aged parents
                  while they are still alive and living in it; although this may
                  save him years of waiting for accommodation on the ever
                  growing waiting lists, the arrangement lacks permanence where
                  the house is rented, since the son might be evicted when his
                  parents, in whose name the house is let, die.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So in old age, many are forced to leave their urban homes and
                  to search for a new home in a rural area where they can hope
                  for a little support. Most urban residents maintain some
                  contact with rural relatives, both for social reasons and as a
                  security against old age or unemployment. But this does not
                  mean that they regard the rural area as their home, nor does
                  it mean that they will go to live in a rural area if they can
                  possibly avoid it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even elderly townspeople may try to keep going in the towns by
                  obtaining a small income through petty trade (often illegal)
                  and taking in lodgers, before going to a rural area as a last
                  resort to keep alive. With the various forces pushing people
                  to the towns and then back into the country, a number of
                  factors are influential in making people clearly urban in
                  orientation, and increasingly stabilized in the urban
                  environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Income level is one: the higher a family's income, the more
                  likely is that family to settle permanently in a city. The
                  security of home ownership is another. And the longer a person
                  lives in an urban centre, the less likely he is to return to a
                  rural area. Associated with greater commitment to urban areas
                  are a decreased reliance on kin, a weakening of the social
                  networks derived from the rural areas, and a greater
                  involvement in urban social institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>FAMILY LIFE IN THE TOWNS</strong><br />
                  The most fundamental change brought about by the urban
                  situation on Shona social life is in their family structure.
                  In the towns, one has to take accommodation where one can find
                  it, which is usually away from family and kin. Also, where
                  houses cater for families at all, they are designed for small
                  elementary families each consisting of simply the husband, his
                  wife and their children, and the accommodation is often very
                  cramped even for these.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Where a family does have outsiders staying with them, these
                  are likely to be unrelated lodgers or more distant kin who can
                  be expected to pay for their accommodation to help the family
                  defray the expenses of town life. As a result, the rural
                  system of extended families living together must break down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A man is rarely able to live with a polygamous family in a
                  town: apart from the problem of cramped accommodation, an
                  extra wife in the towns is not able to cultivate her own field
                  and, instead of being the economic asset she is in the
                  country, she becomes a further burden on strained family
                  resources. So in the towns, the most common household unit is
                  an elementary family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, extended kinship obligations are maintained and,
                  since accommodation is usually short in the towns, most
                  families have one or two kinsmen staying with them, at least
                  on a temporary basis while they seek employment and
                  alternative housing. But such arrangements are usually
                  temporary, and one does not find whole families living
                  together as happens in the rural areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since in a traditional rural home a man lives with his close
                  kin and is partly dependent on them, these are able to apply
                  considerable pressure on his behavior. The social control of
                  kinsmen maintaining customary standards of behavior is absent
                  in the towns, and one of the effects of this is seen in a
                  changing system of marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Marriages now are usually arranged by the couple concerned,
                  their relatives having very little say in the choice of
                  spouses. The bride-price payments are made by the prospective
                  husband to his bride's father (or to his successor if the
                  father is dead), and they concern no one but these two men.
                  Often the two families are completely unknown to each other,
                  and may even be from different tribes: neither family has the
                  traditional vested interest in bride-price cattle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the traditional controls of kinship and village
                  communities are absent, the father-in-law may decide that the
                  only way to ensure the payment of the bride-price without
                  undue delay is by insisting that it is all paid before he
                  gives his consent to the registration of the marriage (a
                  necessary procedure before the husband may apply for married
                  accommodation).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps a more fundamental reason for this practice is the
                  protection of his daughter. Once the husband is independent
                  with a home of his own, he is able to reject his wife and take
                  in any woman that meets his fancy; he may be prepared to do
                  this if he has paid only a small portion of his bride-price
                  which he can waive, but he would be more reluctant if he has
                  paid the full marriage consideration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whatever his reasons, the father-in-law is unlikely to forbid
                  the couple living together once payments have started (in
                  accordance with traditional practice); he simply prevents the
                  registration of the marriage until the husband is able to pay
                  the full consideration, which with the current practice of
                  demanding very high bride-price may take some years. This
                  encourages loose informal unions, already common on account of
                  the unstable urban populations and the preponderance of men
                  among young adults.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But when the couple are serious about their marriage, they may
                  live in the home of either parents until the husband has been
                  able to pay the full bride-price and find a home of his own.
                  Thus a return to the pattern of residential extended families
                  is beginning to appear in the poorer township circles, but on
                  a temporary basis and in extremely cramped circumstances: one
                  may find in a small three-roomed house the house-holder and
                  his wife, a couple of children with their unofficial spouses,
                  a number of younger children, and perhaps some very young
                  grandchildren.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This arrangement is explicitly temporary and does not yet
                  typify the family structure in the towns, in which the
                  elementary family unit is dominant. The dominant residential
                  pattern of elementary families living among strangers has
                  brought about changes in lifestyle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Young wives gain a certain independence in the management of
                  their households, which they could never have living within
                  their husbands' extended families; though against this, they
                  lose the help of relatives, especially to look after young
                  children while they do their chores.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The traditional relationships between men, women and children
                  sometimes become less formal as a result of the family being
                  isolated among strangers; it is now not uncommon to find in an
                  urban area a man eating together with his wife and children,
                  something that would never happen in a more traditional
                  setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it does not follow that members of an elementary family
                  necessarily come closer together in an urban situation. The
                  contrary seems usually to be the case. The reason for the
                  dominance of the elementary family is the absence of kin
                  rather than any strengthening of ties within the family. It is
                  true that the isolation of the family can and often does
                  strengthen its internal bonds, but this does not always
                  happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have seen the difficult position in which women find
                  themselves in the towns, and it is clear that the traditional
                  Shona relationship between husband and wife does not easily
                  adapt itself to the urban environment. Since a woman in a
                  public place may readily be taken for a prostitute, few
                  husbands are prepared to take their wives out in public.
                </p>
                <figure class="size-full">
                  <img loading="lazy" src="beers.webp" alt="Beer hall" />
                </figure>
                <p>
                  Yet there are no restraints on the men who (in accordance with
                  traditional ways) prefer the company of other men to that of
                  women, and who may spend much of their time with their mates
                  in beer halls and other places of entertainment or relaxation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, although the wife is isolated from her own and her
                  husband's kin, she does not necessarily see more of her
                  husband than she would in a traditional rural setting. The
                  weakness of the relationship between husband and wife in urban
                  families becomes clear when the husband's family visit the
                  home for any length of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The husband's parents, brothers and sisters regard their
                  kinsman's home as their own, and his wife as the outsider she
                  would be in a rural homestead. The urban wife's status as lady
                  of the house is dependent not on any new relationship with her
                  husband, but simply on the absence of more traditional
                  contenders for the title.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This attitude is illustrated in an extreme form in the system
                  of inheritance of a dead man's estate that has become common
                  among Shona in the towns. Although any man can will his
                  property to his wife, few in fact do so: some are ignorant of
                  the procedures, some do not bother with them, and many do not
                  trust women with their estates on the grounds that a widow can
                  always marry again and squander her late husband's wealth on
                  another family (ignoring the fact that kinsmen are equally
                  likely to squander the savings of a late relative without
                  taking proper care of the deceased's own children).
                </p>
                <p>
                  And even should a man will his property to his widow, he
                  cannot, if his marriage is registered as a customary marriage,
                  give to his wife the custody of his children after his death.
                  In practice, on the death of the husband, his family has no
                  control over his widow, who lives on her own some distance
                  from them, and they suspect that she will try to remove some
                  of her late husband's property for her own use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the same time, the husband's kin are not constrained by the
                  traditional social sanctions to see that due respect is paid
                  to the dead man's property, and that his widow and children
                  are properly cared for. So immediately on the death of a man,
                  his brothers are likely to come in to strip the homestead of
                  all but the widow's personal property, leaving her with a bare
                  home and no one to help her pay for food and rent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Neither are the bonds between parents and children necessarily
                  strengthened in the elementary families of the towns. The fact
                  that there are no kin of the children's generation in the
                  vicinity of their home does not necessarily drive the children
                  to their parents: children are likely to associate with school
                  mates or gangs of their own age, who are less under the
                  control of their parents than are kin in the rural homesteads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Parents often fail to take over the roles of absent kin like
                  the father's sister and the grand-parents, who in traditional
                  society have important parts to play in the education of
                  children. The children learn town ways and receive little
                  education in Shona customs, resulting in a substantial
                  generation gap which is recognised by all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One result of the weakening links between parents and
                  children, and between children and traditional society, is
                  that people born and brought up in town often do not know how
                  to behave correctly when they visit relatives in the country.
                  They have not learnt the details of traditional social
                  patterns or the formal greetings due to different senior kin
                  or relatives by marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Besides, they are likely to have a higher standard of living
                  than rural kin and children in the towns are more aware of
                  wealth differentials than absent patterns of kinship: parents
                  of such children may find it difficult to persuade them to pay
                  due respect to rural elders which may involve sitting on the
                  ground and soiling their smart town clothes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even adults often find it difficult to sit down and talk to
                  kinsmen from a social stratum lower than their own. Many urban
                  families try to overcome this problem by sending their
                  children to stay with rural kin for a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a survey of children at a secondary school in Highfield,
                  all of the 103 children interviewed had been brought up in
                  urban areas; yet 90% of the girls and 82% of the boys had
                  spent some time staying with a grandmother in the rural areas,
                  and the majority said that they had been taught their manners
                  by grandmothers and fathers' sisters (<em>vatete</em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  But this kind of education serves only further to hide the
                  growing divergence between the traditional ideals of kinship
                  to which nearly all Shona give at least notional assent, and
                  the new patterns of relationships necessitated by urban life.
                  Difficulties about behavior and lifestyle also arise on the
                  other side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rural dwellers visiting kin in town may not find it easy to
                  fit into town ways, and may not understand the financial
                  constraints against extending in towns the lavish hospitality
                  mutually expected by kin in rural areas. People who move
                  permanently into urban areas inevitably find their numerous
                  kinship ties weakened.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One way in which this is reflected is in a lowering of
                  reliance on kin. In rural areas, and even among transitory
                  labour migrants, the Shona normally rely largely on kin for
                  help when they are in difficulty or in need. In the towns
                  there is still a tendency to rely on kin for more traditional
                  needs, such as help in sickness or to pay a fine or for care
                  of one's property in one's absence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For new needs, however, such as money for rent or school fees
                  or to buy some specified article, townspeople tend to rely
                  more on friends, neighbors, co-workers, welfare institutions
                  and others who are not kin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And this independence of kin spreads to more traditional needs
                  as people become more committed to town ways. The weakening of
                  ties does not usually mean that these ties are broken off
                  completely. Many people have settled permanently in a city,
                  have rejected the traditional way of life in favour of a more
                  westernized culture, and are financially secure and
                  independent of kin; even these are likely to keep in touch
                  with more backward rural kin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This may be partly an insurance against financial or other
                  catastrophe, particularly if one day they require the help of
                  kinsmen to appease family spirits. But it is also due to
                  natural social ties, which may be modified to meet new
                  circumstances,but which few would wish to destroy entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>NEW FORMS OF UNION</strong><br />
                  The definition of marriage in urban situations has become
                  somewhat confused. In many cases, there are unions in which
                  all customary rights and conditions have been fulfilled, yet
                  which have not been registered in any way: such unions are
                  socially recognized as marriages, but have little legal
                  status.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In some cases husband and wife are living together according
                  to custom, while the father of the wife refuses to give his
                  formal consent, to the marriage, perhaps because he is holding
                  out for further payments from his son-in-law.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the past, this consent was necessary for the registration
                  of the marriage: although now legally a girl over the age of
                  18 has full adult status and is no longer dependent on
                  parental permission, it is socially difficult for her to
                  assert her rights against her family, on whom she may become
                  dependent in times of trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In practice, the status of any union which does not have the
                  parental consent of the women, and the rights of the two
                  parties to it, are somewhat tenuous. There are marriages in
                  which bride-price as been agreed and promised, but not paid:
                  these may have full legal status, while they are less secure
                  from the social point of view.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet another variety of marital types appears in
                  <em>mapoto</em> unions. These comprise a new form of union in
                  urban situations, in which a man and a woman live together
                  although no bride-price is paid. Many Shona reject the idea
                  that such unions are properly to be called marriages: they are
                  referred to as <em>mapoto</em> (pots), suggesting simply a
                  convenient sharing of cooking arrangements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, sometimes the union is a short-term, temporary
                  convenience for both parties. Nevertheless, many
                  <em>mapoto</em> unions are relatively stable, lasting ten
                  years and more, and involve a contractual arrangement which
                  has been partially recognised by a Shona urban court.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The man takes responsibility to provide for the woman and her
                  children; and the woman looks after the man's home and she
                  agrees to sexual fidelity towards him. It is legitimate,
                  therefore, to speak of <em>mapoto</em> unions as a type of
                  marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reasons a man may have for entering into a
                  <em>mapoto</em> union are various. One is the domestic need of
                  a migrant worker who has left his wife and family at his rural
                  home. A stable union with a woman in town can solve the
                  problem, without creating complications when the migrant
                  eventually returns home. A man may enter into a union with a
                  salaried woman in order to alleviate financial difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A number of Christian men, whose legal wives are barren or
                  bore no sons, have entered into secret
                  <em>mapoto</em> marriages with other women until such time as
                  the desired children can be adopted by the legal wives. In all
                  cases, the legal wife may or may not have prior knowledge of
                  the union: often, but not always, the husband has her sympathy
                  and the union her approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In all these cases, the attraction of a
                  <em>mapoto</em> marriage is its relative stability on the one
                  hand, and, on the other, its lack of formality, making it easy
                  to dissolve and possible to be kept clandestine. Women who
                  enter <em>mapoto</em> marriages usually have little hope of a
                  more formal marriage, either because they have been previously
                  married and divorced or widowed, or because they already have
                  illegitimate children to care for.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For such women in an urban area, a man can provide the
                  security of a home and maintenance. Some women regard the
                  equality and relative independence they maintain in a
                  <em>mapoto</em>
                  marriage as preferable to the subordinate position they are
                  forced to accept in a formal marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is especially true of divorcees, who have been made aware
                  that formal marriage does not guarantee security. The family
                  of a girl who has entered a <em>mapoto</em> marriage is
                  usually presented with a fait accompli. Some families may
                  resent the union, and try to break it up or exact bride-price
                  payments from the husband. But in practice, usually the girl
                  is not readily marriageable before entering the union, and is
                  less so afterwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The loss to the family is minimal, and often the husband is
                  accepted as a traditional son-in-law, who presents his wife's
                  parents with occasional gifts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although many Shona think of <em>mapoto</em> unions as similar
                  to prostitution, and although both are relatively new to Shona
                  society, brought about largely by urban environments, the two
                  are very different. There are a number of factors that
                  encourage prostitution in urban areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One is the desire of relatively poor women to acquire a
                  certain economic independence from their husbands, which may
                  result in limited clandestine prostitution. Another is the
                  desire of girls to be free of kin and of unpleasant domestic
                  service. Certainly a girl can, through prostitution, earn an
                  income which allows her to live in a style far beyond the
                  means of most women.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Prostitution is usually shunned by married women, but there is
                  little stigma attached to the profession, and professional
                  prostitutes are usually quite open about the way in which they
                  make their living. A Shona girl who earns a good living
                  through prostitution in towns may be received well by her
                  family in the rural area, which will adopt any children she
                  may have.
                </p>

                  <figcaption>Women are becoming fashion-conscious</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  A further factor which encourages prostitution are conditions
                  which make any kind of family life impossible. I have
                  mentioned the living conditions of many domestic servants in
                  this respect. Another instance are the hostels in some of the
                  old townships, which housed single men in very cramped
                  conditions (as many as five to a room), with communal kitchens
                  and mess rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A study of hostels in Mbare revealed that half the residents
                  were married men, and that their average age was just under
                  thirty. The bachelor accommodation for most of them was
                  consequently inappropriate to their age and status. The hostel
                  dwellers were largely rurally orientated, with little stake in
                  urban life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some (13 %) commuted weekly from their rural homes, where
                  their wives and families lived; but the majority only went
                  home once a fortnight (30%) or once a month (53 %). In spite
                  of attempts to provide recreational facilities for hostel
                  dwellers, large numbers of men living in these conditions
                  represent a significant disruption of normal family life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS</strong><br />
                  One of the consequences of leaving rural areas, where social
                  life revolves around kinship and local communities, is that
                  people have to find companionship through other associations.
                  Since an urban population is large and heterogeneous, physical
                  proximity is not an adequate basis for choosing one's
                  companions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have mentioned the growth of women's clubs in towns, in
                  which women can gather for companionship and mutual help in
                  running their urban homes; there are numerous other voluntary
                  associations in which men, women or children with some common
                  interest can meet and find companions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most common among men are the informal clubs in which members
                  pool their wages, and take it in turn to keep the pool to buy
                  some expensive item. Many men are also members of football
                  clubs, where they find their weekend entertainment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another common financial type of club are burial societies,
                  which for a small regular subscription provide donations and
                  support immediately after a death in a family, and guarantee
                  funds for a good burial, often including transport of the
                  corpse to the rural home; burial societies also provide
                  various other benefits, including social activities for their
                  members, who gather from time to time for music, feasting and
                  dancing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And there are associations for different professions,
                  co-operative societies, clubs for dancing and for various
                  sports, numerous religious groups and societies, youth clubs,
                  charitable organizations, and even occasional drinking clubs.
                  Some of these bring together co-workers or strangers with
                  common interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But some are dominated by people from a particular area: this
                  applies particularly to many religious associations, since
                  different denominations have defined territorial spheres of
                  influence in the rural areas. Thus by joining a voluntary
                  association connected with the mission church operative in his
                  home rural area, a man in town is likely to meet others from
                  the same area, and to keep up with news of relatives in the
                  country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>SOCIAL CONTROL</strong><br />
                  In the towns, associates from a man's rural place of origin
                  may serve not only as companions with interests common to his
                  own, but also to provide some other functions of a traditional
                  local community, particularly an element of social control. At
                  the simplest level, they can report on his behavior to the
                  rural community, whose goodwill he must preserve should he
                  ever need to return to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, senior men from a particular tribal group often hold an
                  informal court in a town to solve along traditional lines any
                  disputes that may arise within the group. This kind of
                  institution is especially popular among those who through
                  preference or necessity regard their stay in town as
                  temporary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>STRATIFICATION</strong><br />
                  Achievements in education, professions and wealth receive more
                  recognition in the towns than does status due to noble birth
                  or kinship relations. Thus an emerging class structure in the
                  towns replaces the old structure based entirely on wealth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One may meet a very wealthy entrepreneur, who continues to eat
                  stiff porridge with his fingers as the principal ingredient of
                  his diet, who speaks only a little broken English, who keeps a
                  polygamous family and upholds the traditional relationships
                  between men, women and children within the family; such a man
                  is not likely to be wholly acceptable in the upper class of
                  professional men, although the standards of these depend on
                  their being significantly more wealthy than most townsmen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The kind of work a man does, as well as his way of life and
                  his wealth, is relevant to his social class. Professional men
                  have normally received long formal education in western
                  oriented institutions. They tend to live in select, upper
                  class localities in the towns. Men in this class usually marry
                  educated wives who are comparatively emancipated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The family is likely to base its lifestyle, including housing,
                  dress, eating arrangements and entertainments, on western
                  society, and they often speak English rather than Shona when
                  they meet. They usually look down on, and discourage
                  approaches from, people (and even sometimes kin) whom they
                  regard as socially below them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This does not mean that even upper class Shona become simply
                  European in their outlook and way of life. Much from Shona
                  culture always remains. No respectable Shona man would, for
                  example, regard his father's brother's son as a cousin rather
                  than a brother. In numerous ways, any person's cultural
                  background is bound to affect his thinking and behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But much time spent in alternative environments, during formal
                  education and at work, results in professional people being
                  less tied to traditional culture than are most other Shona.
                  Although there have always been differences between rich and
                  poor in Shona society, in the modem urban situation, these are
                  greatly increased and have developed into clear divisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In cities, the rich are able to separate themselves off from
                  the rest in upper class residential areas. In these exclusive
                  areas, the clothes they wear, the food and drink they consume,
                  the education they arrange for their children, are all way
                  beyond the means of the majority of Shona. The result is that
                  from childhood onwards, different urban strata become
                  separated from each other, creating the modern Shona society
                  with its unlimited variations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the lower end of urban strata are squatter camps, in which
                  homeless people live in makeshift shelters of polythene sheets
                  and various scraps of wood, cardboard, iron sheeting and
                  anything else that can be found lying about. Such settlements
                  are liable to grow in urban areas everywhere, and under past
                  white governments were demolished by authorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Against popular misconceptions everywhere, the settlements do
                  not accommodate only destitute newcomers to cities. A survey
                  of one squatter camp near Harare showed that four fifths of
                  household heads had been living in Harare for six years or
                  more (some had been living in the settlement for eighteen
                  years before they were moved), and less than one fifth were
                  unemployed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most of these, together with the majority of wives, are likely
                  to be employed in some kind of informal trade. They are people
                  who for various reasons (income, nationality, lack of
                  employment, marital status, and others) have not been able to
                  acquire more satisfactory accommodation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The number of homeless people in the cities grew dramatically
                  during the war years, as families fled the insecurity and
                  violence of the rural areas, and government began to provide
                  communal water and toilet facilities for people who would rent
                  small plots for their rough shelters.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The way of life of townspeople is not simply determined by the
                  economic strata in which they live. Not every wealthy or
                  professional person makes a radical break with his or her
                  past. In no area of change is there a strict uniformity,
                  common to all Shona society.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A wealthy professional man may be conservative in his way of
                  life, keep his family arrangements in accordance with
                  traditional patterns, and religiously maintain his respect to
                  his spirit elders to the exclusion of newer religious
                  practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A poor couple in their traditional rural home, who have not
                  the means to change much in their lives, may nevertheless
                  place their marriage and their nuclear family above all the
                  traditionally stronger kinship ties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although we find patterns of life and patterns of change
                  common to most, we cannot with any certainty predict how any
                  individual will react to a new situation. Any stereotype of
                  the black man in Zimbabwe today is bound to be false, and
                  there is no such person as the "typical Shona".
                </p>
                <p>
                  Phrases such as "knowing the African" or "the African way of
                  life", so common among white Zimbabweans, dangerously obscure
                  the immense diversity in contemporary African society. Indeed,
                  among the Shona themselves, it is all too easy to assume that
                  one knows one's people and one's culture, without being fully
                  aware of the plurality that has developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A broad common language often blinds people to the diversity
                  of local traditions: it is much more likely to obscure the
                  diversity that is developing in the modem plural world. The
                  Shona peoples today are not the Shona peoples of pre-colonial
                  times, not even the peoples of thirty years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona are involved in a process of change from a culture
                  without literature and with little technology and little
                  centralization, to a culture which incorporates a growing
                  knowledge derived from literature, and dense population
                  centres to meet the growth of industry.

                  This change leads people in divergent directions, but all are
                  caught up in it and all must adapt to it. Although some may
                  hanker after the simplicity and surety of an idealized past,
                  the Shona past was a response to an environment which, both
                  physically and socially, has been surpassed and can never
                  return.

                    Most of the men had jobs in Salisbury, developed a sense of
                    ambition and worked hard to add to their material
                    possessions. A rising standard of living became the most
                    important consideration, and they clamoured for higher
                    wages, better, European-style houses, and all the new status
                    symbols.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We were behaving like any group of white settlers living in
                    the suburbs of Salisbury or Bulawayo, whose lives were
                    mainly governed by the size of their bank accounts, houses,
                    farms or cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It hardly seemed credible that less than thirty years
                    before, my people completely spurned European materialism.
                    It hardly seemed possible that the tribe had once absolutely
                    refused to work for money and had had to be coerced by white
                    people with the sjambok.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, they had been condemned as an utterly backward and
                    indolent people who would take centuries to understand the
                    most elementary concepts of European civilisation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, after only a few decades of white teaching, they were
                    behaving in most things like their conquerors. The majority
                    of them accepted the idea of employment, together with its
                    unrelenting disciplinary code which demanded regular hours,
                    obedience and responsibility to those who hired them in
                    return for wages. (<em>From Rhodesia to Zimbabwe</em>)
