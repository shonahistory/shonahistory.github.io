                <p>
                  About the year 850 A.D. the people called the proto-Vakaranga
                  left the shores of Lake Tanganyika and crossed the Zambezi.
                  They passed through the Tonga communities living in the region
                  of Hurungwe Mountain and settled over a large area south of
                  the Mupfure River. There they founded a state called Guruuswa,
                  which stretched towards the places we now call Bulawayo and
                  Masvingo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  About 1440 A.D. the ruler of this kingdom, the Prince Mutota,
                  became desperately short of salt. Having learnt from an envoy
                  that salt was plentiful further north, in Hurungwe and
                  Sipolilo, he marched in that direction with his family and
                  people and crushed the small, weak communities of the Tavara
                  and Tonga, some of whom had to flee to the other side of the
                  Zambezi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mutota finally settled in the Dande, between the Angwa and
                  Musengezi Rivers. The Tavara, broken by the new invasion, gave
                  to Mutota a name which you will all recognise. They called him
                  <em>Mwene Mutapa</em>, the master of ravaged lands or the
                  master-pillager. Mutota's followers, who spoke Chikaranga,
                  liked the word and added it to their own language as
                  <em>Nemutapa</em>, which is only one of its many forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the keen word-sense of the Tavara did not stop there. For
                  the people who came into the Dande with Mutota, they coined
                  the phrase <em>Makorekore</em>, because they swept over the
                  land like a swarm of locusts.
                </p>

                    Embire is a fortress of the king of Monomotapa, which he is
                    now making of stone without mortar, which is called
                    Gamanhaya (KwaMunyai), and where he always is. From there
                    onwards is the kingdom of Monomotapa, which is the source of
                    the gold of all this land. He is the chief king of all
                    these, and all obey him from Monomotapa to Sofala
                  </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  Mutota established his court on the western bank of the Utete
                  River, near a hill called Chitako-Changonya. There he built a
                  large and solid oval stone fort, a <em>dzimbabwe</em>, the
                  ruins of which can still be seen. Mutota is buried in a shrine
                  at the top of Chitako-Changonya.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His successor Matope seems not to have liked living in the
                  Lomagundi district, and moved his court from the Utete to the
                  Biri River, just on the other side of the Mozambique border.
                  Perhaps he thought that this was a better place from which to
                  extend his empire, which, when he died, stretched to the
                  shores of the Indian Ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A usurper called Changamire took the throne for four years,
                  but suffered the fate of most of his kind in about 1490, when
                  Chikuyo Chisamarengu murdered him. Chikuyo had a more
                  favorable opinion of Lomagundi than Matope the empire-builder
                  and came back to the ancestral home on the Utete, the old hub
                  of the kingdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There he died in about 1530. But before he died, he may have
                  met the Portuguese traveler, Antonio Fernandes. Fernandes was
                  a "degredado", an outcast who, as a punishment for some
                  unknown crime, was put on a ship bound for Sofala on the East
                  African coast.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He could neither read nor write, and we should know nothing
                  about him if it were not for a clerk called Gaspar Veloso.
                  Veloso took down what Fernandes had to say about his two
                  attempts (made about 1513) to discover where all the gold came
                  from that flowed into Sofala.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Very few of the names mentioned by Veloso fit in with the ones
                  we use today and the most important of all, the fortress
                  called Embire, may have been the Utete dzimbabwe or the other
                  one which had been built by Matope in Portuguese East Africa.
                  Certainly the words Biri and Embire are very similar.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The story now moves forward about forty years, to the year
                  1561. The ruler at this time was Nogomo Mupunzagutu. He, like
                  Chikuyo, lived on the left bank of the Utete. In January, he
                  met a Portuguese missionary of noble blood called Goncalo da
                  Silveira. Silveira had come to Mozambique from Goa in 1560,
                  full of the zeal of the Jesuits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After traveling up the Zambezi to Tete, he struck overland
                  through the Darwin district, where the Queen of Sheba is
                  supposed to have loaded her camels with gold, and at last got
                  to the Mwene Mutapa's court. Nogomo offered him cattle and
                  gold and women, but Silveira sent them all back. He wanted
                  only to convert the king to Christianity. And this he did. By
                  the end of the month, Nogomo had allowed Silveira to baptise
                  him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then the troubles began. Muslim traders at the court were
                  extremely jealous of the Jesuits, not only because they were
                  of a different faith, but because their own influence with the
                  Mwene Mutapa was bound to decline if he became a Christian.
                  They therefore began a campaign of lies against Silveira. They
                  spread dark rumours about the bad effect of sprinkling holy
                  water.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nogomo, not yet free from the superstitions of his tribe,
                  quickly revoked his new faith and, on 16 March 1561, had
                  Silveira strangled and thrown into a pond at the junction of
                  the Musengezi and Utete Rivers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After Silveira's death, the Jesuits left the country and did
                  not return until 1607. A military force set sail from Lisbon
                  about ten years later to punish the Mwene Mutapa. Francisco
                  Barreto led a party of soldiers up the Zambezi. He failed
                  completely. He had plenty of arms and ammunition and his men
                  were undoubtedly brave, but they could not fight two enemies
                  at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What killed Barreto and most of his troops and horses was not
                  the assegai or the poisoned arrow, but disease. The tsetse fly
                  got the horses and malaria the men. But where the sword
                  failed, more peaceful methods succeeded. Trading posts,
                  churches, mining settlements grew up in the Mwene Mutapa's
                  kingdom and finally in the early seventeenth century he gave
                  all the gold in his dominions to the King of Portugal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What Silveira had tried and failed to do was done by the
                  Dominicans, who converted several of Nogomo's descendants with
                  less tragic results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the earliest hunters and travelers from south of the
                  Limpopo came into Mashonaland in the 1860s they found, not a
                  powerful, centralized kingdom of warlike people, but a mild,
                  industrious, disunited and more or less peaceable folk with no
                  soldier class or military tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The glories of the sixteenth century had long since faded.
                  Mzilikazi, the despot of Matabeleland, in some sense Mwene
                  Mutapa's heir, discouraged white penetration for fear that
                  hunters would sell firearms to the Mashona.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jan Viljoen, Piet Jacob and Henry Hartley came as far as the
                  Mupfure river in 1865, but they valued their hunting rights
                  too highly to go any further. It was on this trip that Hartley
                  saw the pits and shafts which he suspected were ancient gold
                  workings.

                    Hartley discovers gold, 1865. Painting by Thomas Baines. The
                    back of the canvas bears the following inscription: "What
                    led to the discovery of the South African Gold Fields. Mr
                    Hartley and his Matebeli servant elephant hunting among
                    quartz rocks and old diggings in the Northern Goldfields
                    1865 and 1866. T. Baines, Durban, Natal, Septr. 28 1874."
                    This was the last painting by Baines who died seven months
                    later.

                </figure>
                <p>
                  A couple of years later he came back with the German
                  geologist, Carl Mauch, to confirm the discovery and the gold
                  rush began. In 1868 a book appeared in London with the title
                  <abbr
                    style="user-select: none"
                    tip="To Ophir direct or, the South African Gold Fields with a map showing the route taken by Hartley and Mauch, in 1866-67 and an account of the South African Republic by BamangWato"
                    >To Ophir Direct</abbr
                  >, which gives a fair idea of the Old Testament visions which
                  hypnotised the early prospectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Frederick Courtney Selous the hunter landed at Algoa Bay in
                  1871. On 24 November 1877, he reached the mouth of the Munyati
                  River just at the western entrance to Kariba Gorge. He
                  actually stood on the north bank and threw stones across.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He thought that "the breadth of the Zambezi, where it runs
                  through the narrow gorge of Kariba, in many places cannot be
                  more than sixty yards, narrower than at any other place I had
                  yet seen. It seems to have worn a deep channel through the
                  hard rock, through which it rushes with a strong current, full
                  of whirlpools and eddies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After getting clear of the gorge, Selous crossed from the
                  north bank on 29 November 1877, at a little island and walked
                  for a short distance along the opposite side. About twelve
                  miles from the Kafue he went over to Cassoko Island, where the
                  Portuguese had a post.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Christmas Day, 1877, Selous' stores ran out. On his way back
                  to the Falls, both he and his companion fell ill.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By May of the next year, Selous was fit again and revisited
                  Matabele country with the idea of joining a group of hunters
                  in Mashonaland. He came back to Lomagundi's on 25 October for
                  corn. He noticed, like everyone else, that
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    in the mountains about here, extensive excavations have been
                    made, but whether for gold or iron we could not learn.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The corn he got cost more than usual and on the return trip
                  crocodiles ate three of his dogs. Nevertheless, he was back
                  again in 1880, for a journey into the tsetse fly country north
                  of the Mupfure. Again he visited Lomagundi, whom he described
                  as
                </p>

                  In contrast to the dirty and slovenly people he found on the
                  north bank of the Zambezi in 1877, Lomagundi's people seemed
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    very industrious, cultivating great quantities of sorghum,
                    mealies, groundnuts and a few sweet potatoes; they had any
                    amount of vegetable food and lots of beer.

                  He saw cotton being woven and Lomagundi himself, courteous as
                  ever, offered to accompany Selous.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The old chief wore a broad-brimmed straw hat and a
                    gaily-coloured Portuguese cloth bound round his loins and
                    hanging to the ground all round him like a skirt: over his
                    left shoulder he carried a strong, 10-bore muzzle loading
                    rifle, a present, so he told me, from Lobengula, and in his
                    right hand a battle-axe made, handle and blade, entirely of
                    native Mashona iron
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  When the chief appeared in all this finery, his people began
                  an "infernal and monotonous tom-toming" which got on Selous'
                  nerves. He came yet again to Lomagundi in June 1882. After a
                  few weeks of shooting he came into a desolate country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All that portion of the country, he said, had, at no very
                  distant date, been thickly populated, whilst large patches of
                  thick forest had been cleared for the cultivation of maize,
                  sweet potatoes, etc. Every cluster of rocks had been the site
                  of a Mashona village, many of which had not long been
                  deserted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the ever-present fear of invasion by the cruel and
                  bloodthirsty Matabele had caused the natives of this rich and
                  fertile tract of country to desert the home of their
                  forefathers and retreat towards the east and north.

                  In 1878 he had passed through the country of Chaminuka,
                  between the Mupfure and Manyame rivers, and found more
                  evidence of the harsh power of the Matabele. Chaminuka for
                  several years enjoyed immunity from Matabele attack and his
                  people grew fairly rich and prosperous.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early in 1883, however, Lobengula ordered Chaminuka to be
                  killed while he was on his way to pay homage at Bulawayo. His
                  people fled beyond the Mazowe River but his young wife, a
                  Matabele girl, was captured and taken back to Matabeleland.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She managed to run away and Selous found her living among
                  Lomagundi's people in Mashonaland. A sad little story, but by
                  no means unique in those years of Matabele dominance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1887, Selous made his last visit to Lomagundi before the
                  occupation. It was then that he found the Chinhoyi caves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Baboons and bats used the caves as a ready-made home. The
                  caves got the name <em>Chirorodziwa</em> or "pool of the
                  Falls" when Zwangendaba came through the district with his
                  Angoni in the 1830s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He was running away from Shaka and on his arrival in Lomagundi
                  the people rushed for safety to the caves and, in their hurry,
                  many of them fell over the edge and were either killed on the
                  rocks or drowned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For many years the cave was unoccupied. In fact it was not
                  until the appearance of the Matabele that any natives lived in
                  the vicinity. Then one Chinhoyi built his village there and
                  successfully resisted all attacks of the Matabele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chinhoyi lived at the cave until the arrival of the Europeans
                  who, in 1912, destroyed some of the stalactites by shooting
                  them down with rifles.

                  Diogo de Alcacova wrote a much fuller account of the
                  communities of the hinterland, where the successors to the
                  Mwene Mutapa, the Changamire, were raising impressive
                  structures such as Khami and Nalatali. His report on the
                  African chiefdoms inland centred, naturally, on their
                  connections with the gold trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He wrote of the one who claimed overlordship of Karanga lands
                  and their gold, the Mwene Mutapa, his <em>zimbabwe</em> or
                  capital, and of the 12 year old power struggle between the
                  Mwene Mutapa and the Changamire.

                    The word <em>changamire</em> might be derived from the word

                    worthless person") whose mother was a woman of lowly status,
                    and <em>amir</em>, a title suggested by Moorish traders
                    after the first <em>changamir</em>'s successful campaigns

                <p>
                  In the 16th century, the Portuguese employed expendable human
                  resources called <em>degrados</em>, men condemned in Portugal
                  for various crimes and offered freedom in return for
                  undertaking dangerous missions abroad on behalf of the state.

                <p>
                  The degrado agent we know most about was Antonio Fernandes, a
                  ship's carpenter with a gift for languages and an uncanny
                  rapport with strangers.

                    The first king who borders with Sofala is called Mycamdira
                    and there is nothing to be had in his land save supplies and
                    ivory. The king of Embya ... has nothing save banditry ...

                    and ... in his lands they hold fairs on Mondays, called
                    Sembaza fairs where the Moors sell all their merchandise ...
                    The only coin is gold by weight. The king of Mazowe... has
                    much gold in his land and he who mines it pays him half.

                <p>
                  The Monomatapa lived at times in his Zimbabwe of thatched
                  timber buildings, surrounded by a dry stone wall, but had
                  another capital 6 days' journey away, where some of his wives
                  were kept under guard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every year, as a test of allegiance, all fires in the kingdom
                  were extinguished except the Mwene Mutapa's, and subordinate
                  rulers were ordered to receive New Fire from his hearth.
                  Anyone refusing risked annihilation at the hands of the army.

                  At his capital, tribute arrived, borne by long caravans of
                  porters who were never allowed to see the ruler. The Mwene
                  Mutapa were following a long tradition of seclusion, strongly
                  hinted by the design of Great Zimbabwe with its well screened
                  passages.

                  Dress and weapons showed a blend of indigenous fashion and
                  Muslim influence: to the animal skins with tails swirling
                  excitingly in the dances were added dyed cotton fabrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Mwene Mutapa, however, for fear of harmful magic,
                  continued to wear cloth woven in Africa itself.

                <p>
                  Dos Santos, vicar of Sofala at the end of the 16th century
                  mentions the Karanga love of metaphor and notes the whistling
                  sounds in their language, but goes much further than this,
                  incorporating Karanga words into his narrative which enable us
                  to identify the people he describes as the ancestors of the
                  modern Shona-speakers.

                  The Mwene Mutapa ruled from his royal village close to Mount
                  Fura (Mt Darwin), and in his gold-producing areas the
                  Portuguese had established three trade fairs.

                    three rods of authority (<em>tsvimbo</em>), each of his
                    envoys was called a <em>mutumwa</em> and he referred to his
                    northern river boundary as the 'Empando' or Divider
                    (<em>mupanda</em>).

                <p>
                  His authority was often challenged by the Mongas, fierce
                  warriors of the Zambezi valley, who fought in the "<em
                    >head and horns of the ox</em

                  When the Portuguese arrived in the Indian Ocean, the Mwene
                  Mutapa's kingdom was already in the process of fission. Santos
                  described the eastern segment of the old hegemony, under the
                  rule of Kiteve whose customs probably reflect closely those of
                  the Mwene Mutapa.

                    mountains of Manica for ceremonies to ensure the welfare of
                    the community. (The timing suggests rain making rituals). He
                    concealed his face behind a beadwork mask (the "hidden king"
                    again) and the whole company leapt around
                    (<em>kupembera</em>) until one became possessed by a mudzimu

                <p>
                  Inland also the coming of the Portuguese disrupted the
                  existing pattern of trade and hastened the eclipse of the
                  Zimbabwe culture. The collusion between the Mwene Mutapa and
                  the Portuguese in the late 16th and 17th centuries sharpened
                  the rivalry with the Changamire of the south to the point of
                  war which in the late 17th century swept the Portuguese
                  settlers off the plateau.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this, the Portuguese influence was at times to intensify
                  internecine strife in Karangaland, but it would be untrue to
                  conclude that the Portuguese arrival caused it, for the Mwene
                  Mutapa-Changamire conflict was 12 years old when Alcacova was
                  writing in 1506.

                  The Portuguese era also brought from Brazil, at some time in
                  the 16th century, a crop which rapidly became the most
                  important staple cereal in sub-Saharan Africa: <em>maize</em>.

                    established another Mutapa kingdom in Mozambique sometimes
                    called Karanga. The Karanga kings styled themselves the
