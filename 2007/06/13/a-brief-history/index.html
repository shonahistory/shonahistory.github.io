                <p>
                  The collection of independent petty chiefdoms, partly subdued
                  by Ndebele, which the European settlers found (or chose to
                  find) in the late nineteenth century, does not truly reflect
                  Shona history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Soon after they arrived on the East African coast, the
                  Portuguese heard tales of the great Mutapa who ruled the land
                  from the Kalahari desert in the west to the Indian Ocean in
                  the east. But when early traders and missionaries reached him,
                  they were disappointed to find what appeared to them as no
                  more than a petty chief living in a kraal of pole and mud
                  huts. The ruler had moved down into the valley and his
                  influence was waning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The successors to the conquering Mutapa, Nyanhehwe, were
                  unable to maintain a hold over widespread subject peoples, and
                  the state of the Mutapa became a loose collection of
                  independent chiefdoms, being forced only occasionally to pay
                  tribute to a particular powerful Mutapa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Mutapa remained, however, an influential figure, and
                  traders (both Muslim and Portuguese), missionaries and
                  administrators continued to have dealings with his court. The
                  Portuguese even built a small, rough fort near the kraal of
                  the Mutapa in the Zambezi Valley. In later years, the state
                  became disrupted by civil wars as branches of the dynastic
                  family vied for power, sometimes abetted by Portuguese traders
                  and administrators.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The conflict was settled in the seventeenth century when
                  Mutapa Mukombwe came to power with the help of the Portuguese.
                  He restored some stability to the state and redistributed the
                  land to loyal subjects. Thereafter the power of the Mutapa
                  declined and the title finally died after the defeat of
                  Chioko, the last of the Mutapas, by the Portuguese in 1917.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile in the interior, the Torwa state was under stress.
                  By the middle of the seventeenth century it was split by
                  internal strife. Possibly as a result of internal upheavals
                  and population pressures, the capital at Khami was deserted
                  and a new complex was built at Dhlodhlo and Nalatale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At about the same time a group of Rozvi migrated southwards
                  from the north-east of the plateau, probably fleeing the civil
                  wars of the Mutapa state and also the aftermath of the war
                  between the Barwe and the Portuguese. One group moved
                  south-east to found most of the present Ndau dynasties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A more significant group, attracted by the weakness of Torwa,
                  traveled south-west and set up there the new dynasty of
                  Changamire Mambos. Although the Rozvi take-over coincided
                  roughly with the building of a new capital, it appears that
                  the new rulers utilized the structure of the old Torwa state
                  and recognised many of the old officials, with the result that
                  the new and powerful dynasty was established with a minimum of
                  social upheaval.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Aided by a strong military organization, the Changamire
                  controlled a prolonged period of trade with the Portuguese: by
                  this stage alluvial gold was becoming scarce, and the main
                  trade consisted in ivory for cloth, guns and other eastern or
                  European goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Presumably under the Changamire rule, the cult of the high god
                  Mwari, which later survived the collapse of the state and the
                  Ndebele invasion, was established in the Matopo Hills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Rozvi Changamire ruled in the south-west until they were
                  defeated by the invading Ndebele. The dominance of the Rozvi
                  over surrounding chiefly dynasties remains reflected in the
                  instalment ceremonies of many modern Shona chiefs who must
                  have the ritual approval of a member of the Rozvi clan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile, as the population expanded in central Shona country
                  there were numerous movements involving groups of people
                  breaking off from larger chiefdoms. Between chiefdoms and
                  within chiefdoms, intrigues and petty feuds were common.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During these unsettled times, many peoples throughout Shona
                  country had taken to building rough stone refuges on the tops
                  of hills and in caves to which people could flee and where
                  they could easily defend themselves against raiders. By the
                  beginning of the nineteenth century the central plateau was
                  becoming settled and most of the modern chiefdoms had been
                  established.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By this time, they comprised a hotch-potch of chiefly
                  dynasties with a variety of histories, united by geographical
                  proximity and a common culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before the arrival of the white settlers there were two
                  influential settlements from the Nguni peoples of the south in
                  the early nineteenth century. The first was by the Gaza Nguni
                  who settled on the lower Sabi and the second was the invasion
                  of the Ndebele, both off-shoots from the Zulu state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Gaza Nguni were led by Soshangane, the founder of the Gaza
                  state, whose name has subsequently been applied not only to
                  his own people but also to neighboring Ndau and Tsonga
                  peoples. Soshangane's people settled in the far south-east of
                  Shona country and infiltrated surrounding peoples.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They have been influential linguistically and culturally in
                  the Ndau peoples, some of whom were incorporated into the Gaza
                  state. Their realm of influence was mainly in what is now
                  Mozambique, overflowing into the south-east corner of
                  Zimbabwe. They did conduct occasional raids for cattle and for
                  wives in that area.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before finally moving to Portuguese territory, the Shangaans
                  had become paramount over the Mashona tribes in the east. The
                  Sanga and Dondo Mashona, who were incorporated in the Shangaan
                  nation, abandoned their own language and assimilated Nguni
                  customs, but they were the minority of the Mashona tribes to
                  do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ndebele settled in the south-west, conquering the country
                  of the Changamire. They incorporated large numbers of resident
                  Shona into their state; these were considered socially
                  inferior by the Ndebele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The adopted Shona learnt to speak Zulu and even their Shona
                  clan names were translated into Zulu; the language of the
                  Ndebele remains remarkably free of Shona influences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ndebele also adopted the principal religious cult of the local
                  Shona, namely, the cult of the high god Mwari which was fitted
                  into the Ndebele spirit world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ndebele arrived with the powerful military organization
                  developed by the Zulu and were able to conduct occasional
                  raids deep into Shona country, collecting women and cattle
                  from defeated peoples. Nevertheless, these large raids
                  centrally organized by the Ndebele king were infrequent
                  occurrences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the outskirts of Ndebele country raiding between small
                  Ndebele groups and the neighboring Shona was mutual. Indeed,
                  by the time the British arrived, there were indications that a
                  number of southern Shona chiefs were coming together in
                  concerted resistance to the Ndebele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the Ndebele took over the country of the Changamire,
                  and although they expanded their state into Karanga country,
                  it appears that the Shona who were not incorporated into the
                  Ndebele state were on the whole unaffected by the Ndebele
                  settlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So the early colonial view of the Shona as a collection of
                  squabbling petty chiefdoms, subject to the Ndebele state, was
                  clearly false. Shona history shows the rise and fall of a
                  number of larger states, a long history of mining and a
                  history of both internal and external trade. The Shona peoples
                  had for the most part maintained their autonomy against
                  various outside influences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Partly as a matter of convenience, and partly no doubt
                  deceived by the military inferiority of the Shona to the
                  Ndebele invaders, the early white settlers regarded the Shona
                  as unimportant subjects of the Ndebele king and no attempt was
                  made to obtain from them concessions for mining or trading or
                  settlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless the Shona showed themselves reluctant to accept
                  domination by these new invaders who tried to meddle with
                  their way of life on a scale that no previous immigrant group
                  had done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the Ndebele rose against the settlers in 1896, the Shona
                  surprised the whites by joining in and maintaining a concerted
                  resistance which lasted months after the Ndebele war had come
                  to an end.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is true that not all Shona joined in the rising, and that
                  some used the war simply to settle internal conflicts, joining
                  the settlers or the rebels as convenience directed;
                  nevertheless, the petty feuding chiefdoms were able to show
                  remarkable unity and resilience when their independence was
                  seriously challenged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main rising of 1896 was followed by further lesser risings
                  as British and Portuguese colonizers spread their rule. There
                  was the Mapondera war in the north-east of what is now
                  Zimbabwe around the turn of the century, and as late as 1917
                  the Barwe and neighboring Tavara peoples fought against the
                  Portuguese.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But eventually the Shona had to bow to superior military
                  strength, and to submit to the laws and taxes imposed by
                  colonial governments.
                </p>

                    Mapondera, Chief of the MaKoreKore. He was out of the

                    afterwards and his tribe rose in 1900. It was defeated and
                    he fled into Mozambique. There he made contact with the
                    Mwene Mutapa and gained his support. In 1901 he invaded the
                    country at the head of a large KoreKore force, and marched
                    on Mount Darwin with the intention of killing all the whites
                    living there. He clashed with a force of Police which
                    eventually scattered the KoreKore. He was captured and died
                    in gaol during a hunger strike.

                  <strong>THE EUROPEANS</strong><br />
                  The African attitude towards the solitary Europeans who had
                  made their appearance from the 1860's onwards was ambivalent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the one hand, many Africans appear to have recognised the
                  technological superiority of the white men, and the Ndebele at
                  any rate were aware that they were members of a larger tribe,
                  which they respected for virtues not at all incomprehensible

                <p>
                  Yet one cannot but be impressed by the way that many of the
                  chiefs greeted their early European visitorsâ€”rather in the
                  relaxed manner of a member of the aristocracy receiving a
                  formal visit from a person of respectable but decidedly
                  inferior social antecedents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the time that the Pioneer Column came through, many of the
                  chiefs throughout the country must have received such visits.
                  From the African point of view, whether Ndebele or Shona, the
                  occupation must have seemed like a Trojan Horse operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was a sense of shock and outrage when it was realised
                  that the character of these European visits had altered and
                  that the white men had come to stay.

                  They intended, too, to break up all the old trading patterns
                  and replace them with an economy which they controlled. And so
                  the African attitude to the advent of the white people, in
                  about 1892, began to change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The story is told that on the morning after the whites had
                  arrived and hoisted the famous flag at Fort Salisbury, they
                  found a red ox tethered to the pole as a sign of welcome. But
                  after some months, when the Pioneers had shown no signs of
                  moving on, they found a black ox tied to the pole as a kind of
                  delicate, but nevertheless emphatic, indication that they had
                  outstayed their welcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not merely had the whites remained, quite ignoring such
                  warnings, but they were now rudely interfering with African
                  life on an increasing scale. For instance, they expected an
                  abundant supply of labor and when this was not forthcoming,
                  there was no thought of offering greater inducements to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In one instance an Inspector Bodle led a police patrol to a
                  kraal because the headman had refused to send his men to work,
                  saying that â€œhis men were not going to work for white men and
                  that if the police came he would fire on themâ€œ.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The headman was arrested and fined a considerable quantity of
                  stock and given 50 lashes in the presence of men of his own
                  and other kraals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And there were, of course, some much more serious instances
                  where there was considerable loss of life. Now whatever local
                  Africans felt about the presence of white men in their
                  country, most of the white pioneers were completely untroubled
                  by the niceties of their constitutional position and regarded
                  the country as having been taken over for their own benefit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This attitude was expressed on occasion even by hostility to
                  the Company when it attempted to bring about more order in
                  relations between black and white.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One finds the position to be that a large European settler
                  force was busy possessing itself of the choicest parts of
                  Mashonaland on the basis of the fiction that this area was the
                  territory of the Ndebele king who had authorised them to do
                  so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the meantime the interests of the settlers were in complete
                  conflict with those of the said Ndebele king whose actual
                  relations with the area in question were those of a military
                  parasite, alternately raiding its peoples and levying tribute
                  by force.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona, on the other hand, whether in the area subject to
                  Ndebele influence or not, merely desired to continue their
                  age-old way of life, which included a good deal of bickering
                  among themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  White settlement brought about a show of unity among the Shona
                  which the Ndebele raids failed to evoke. Despite all their
                  outrages the Ndebele did not consider trying to change the way
                  of life of the Shona, whereas from quite early times it was
                  clear the Shona way of life and the European way of life were
                  basically incompatible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  H.C. Thomson, a correspondent for The Times of London,
                  captured the issue most succinctly at the time, when he heard
                  that
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Those resisting preferred the Matibili rule to ours, because
                    under them they were troubled but once a year, whereas now
                    their troubles come with each day's rising sun
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The chief was reduced to a person lower than a constable in
                  criminal matters and to the most inferior sort of civil
                  magistrate whose every decision was open to appeal, often by
                  men who could be chiefs' grandsons in age and whose knowledge
                  of tribal law was taken from one or two rather incomplete and
                  erratic textbooks left by early Native Commissioners.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The chiefs' mystical connection with the land was often
                  shattered by imposed tribal movements, the suspension of
                  practices which were deemed to smack of witchcraft, the onset
                  of Christianity, and finally the removal of his right of
                  allocation of land.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Loyalty to the chief and respect due to to him are connected
                  with his sovereignty over the land. If a man was rebuked for
                  passing his chief with little or no formal salutation, he
                  might reply, "Where is the land?", implying that since the
                  white people had dominion over the land the chief had lost his
                  status.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was transferred to agricultural authorities of the
                  Government and it no doubt had a profound effect on weakening
                  the authority of the chief over his people.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The association of the chief with the land is symbolized in
                    the instalment ceremonies of chiefs all over Shona country.
                    Thus in the instalment of Karanga Chief Ziki, the new chief
                    opened his hands which were filled with two handfuls of
                    earth while he was addressed:
                    <em
                      >"You are now Ziki. We hand you the country to hold. Look
                      after us well."</em
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly we find in the history of the Shawasha people that
                    when their chief had occupied the country and killed the old
                    Rozvi chief, he called his people together; when they
                    gathered, one of his followers dug a handful of soil, mixed
                    it with water and gave it to him saying,
                    <em>"Take this soil, Chinamhora".</em> When he took it all
                    the people clapped their hands in recognition of his
                    chiefship.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once a man has formally been given the soil, no one else can
                    become chief until his death.
                  </p>

                  It is even less easy to sum up change in the field of family
                  relations in a few words. The old forms continued to a large
                  extent, but the goodness had gone out of them.

                  Generally, there was a weakening of all social authority, and
                  with it a rise in the incidence of self-willed and antisocial
                  behavior. Social norms to a very major extent rely on the
                  regulative aspects of community life, social disapproval, the
                  quest for social esteem, and so on.

                  Labour migration broke the bounds of the tribal social order
                  and residence for long periods of time in the vast human
                  melting-pots that we call towns completed the bad work.

                      Rushwa of the Shona tribe played the lead role in a 1930s
                      film which told a love story set in the colony of Southern
                      Rhodesia. Here she is seen withstanding an ordeal to which
                      she had been condemned by a council of elders for adultery

                  During the first decade of the 20th century, it came to be
                  realised that the earlier hopes of finding a second
                  Witwatersrand were merely an illusion; but such hopes lived
                  on. The end of the Anglo-Boer War was followed by a mining
                  boom, but this collapsed during the financial crisis of
                  1903-4.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a direct consequence of this, thoughts turned to the
                  potential wealth of land; and an awareness grew of the
                  important role the African agricultural sector had assumed in
                  the economy and the threat it posed to the future labor supply
                  of the Colony.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By 1908, when the white agricultural system began to expand,
                  African agricultural opportunities gradually began to be
                  reduced.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order for white agriculture to be promoted, African
                  agricultural competition had to be eliminated. The BSA Company
                  began to charge rents to Africans living on unalienated land
                  (land that had been appropriated but not yet sold by the
                  BSAC), and a rent of Â£1 per year was levied on all Africans
                  living on such land.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Native Commissioners (NCs) were told to warn natives that they
                  must either move into reserves after the crops had been reaped
                  or be prepared to pay the rent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If Africans chose to move into the reserves, many would be
                  forced to relinquish the ability to sell surplus agricultural
                  products because of the general remoteness from markets of
                  these areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those who chose to remain on white owned land came to play an
                  important role in the development of nascent white
                  agriculture. On occupied white farms, the landowners could
                  exact rents or labor services from their tenants, and they
                  could also charge grazing and dipping fees; thus they were not
                  only contributing financially to white agricultural
                  development, but forming an all-important labor force.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those living on unalienated land were also welcomed as a
                  source of revenue to the BSA Company. The government at this
                  stage made no effort to evict Africans from the land because
                  the white sector was still heavily reliant on African
                  agricultural production.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The charging of rents to Africans residing on white land had
                  the desired results, and from 1909 the rate of migration of
                  Africans from white areas accelerated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The proportion living in reserves increased from 54 per cent
                  in 1909 to 64 per cent in 1922, and at the same time the rate
                  of African production began to decline as poorer and more
                  densely populated land was brought under cultivation. Thus, of
                  necessity, many Africans were forced to seek wage labor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The consequences of this policy were to have a greater impact
                  on the Shona than on the Ndebele. The latter were used to
                  paying rents and preferred to remain on their traditional
                  lands in order to do so, rather than move into reserves.

                  In Mashonaland, however, there were fewer Africans in
                  alienated areas - furthermore, many reserves were in close
                  proximity to both mines and white farms and Africans were
                  still able to market agricultural surplus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As white farming developed and the marketing of African
                  produce was discouraged, the Shona increasingly realised the
                  necessity of seeking wage employment which, after many years
                  of acquiring cash through sale of agricultural surpluses, they
                  were reluctant to accept.
                </p>
                <p>As early as 1903, one NC was heard to have said,</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Whereas at present the natives living in these reserves
                    cultivate as much ground as they please, the products which
                    are in excess of their consumption and the large remaining
                    surplus they sell to traders in order to meet their hut tax
                    and by this mode of living the average Mashona does not
                    require to look for work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a native owned a limited piece of land which would only
                    produce sufficient grain for his own consumption he would be
                    bound to go out in search of employment in order to earn

                  Experimental farms were opened and extension facilities
                  offered to white farmers. In 1912, a Land Bank was set up
                  making credit available to persons of European descent only.
                  The Bank gave loans of up to Â£2,000 for the purchase of farms,

                  When maize began to be grown in abundance in the gold belt
                  area, it had the advantage â€˜of having both the best soil and
                  easy access to markets in the mining centres. African markets
                  in this area were thus taken over by white farmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, as the tobacco industry expanded with its
                  preference for light sandy soils, many Africans in Mashonaland
                  lost access to the land which they had traditionally
                  cultivated. The expansion of the white cattle industry at the
                  same time as that of the African, resulted in increased
                  competition for grazing lands.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The whites began to challenge Africans for markets, cattle and
                  land, beginning what was termed
                  <i>the squeezing-out process</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Prior to 1914, white farmers had not forced Africans off their
                  land. If they chose to leave through pressure created by the
                  imposition of taxes and other devices, they were free to do
                  so, but whites were reluctant to force their eviction because
                  at this stage they supplied crops, labor services and also
                  revenue through fees and rents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By 1914, however, competition for African labor between the
                  mines and the farmers had increased. To complicate matters,
                  white farmers required seasonal labor at precisely the same
                  time that Africans planted their own crops, and they were
                  reluctant to work for white farmers during this period.

                  To achieve the twin goal of both reducing African competition
                  which had become a larger threat during the war years, and
                  discontinuing the general refusal of Africans to work, white
                  farmers began imposing higher rents, grazing and dipping fees
                  on their African tenants.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such action, it was hoped, would force more Africans into the
                  reserves which were further away from the main markets. In
                  this manner, both goals were achieved: competition was of
                  necessity reduced, and Africans were forced to seek wage labor
                  because of their inability to realise a sufficient cash income
                  through the sale of agricultural surplus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The natural consequence of this movement of increasing numbers
                  into the reserves during these years was the acceleration of
                  congestion in these areas. Access to markets was denied them
                  owing to the remoteness of many reserves from the main centers
                  of economic activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  African crop production began to decline, partly as incentive
                  waned with diminishing market potentials, and partly as the
                  practise of extensive methods of agriculture became
                  increasingly difficult to execute under congested conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, cattle numbers increased rapidly during this
                  period, placing more pressure on the land, and incentives to
                  dispose of this surplus through sale deteriorated with the
                  collapse of the cattle market in the 1920s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An additional consequence of the slump in the early 1920s was
                  that many Africans moved into the reserves, having no
                  incentive to pay rent when sale of produce was being
                  uneconomic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having made this decision to migrate to reserve areas, future
                  possibilities of gaining financial requirements through sale
                  of crops was negligible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, whilst for white farmers the slump was merely a
                  temporary downward trend in the business cycle, for the
                  African this situation was, in many ways, irreversible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The instability of white agriculture in the late 1920s and the
                  simultaneous increase in their political power, gave rise to a
                  great deal of aggression towards Africans living on white
                  land.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The white farmers, if they could not achieve satisfaction
                  through the framework of government aid, were more determined
                  to achieve security through other means. The form these
                  desires assumed were pressures for segregation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main pressure for segregation, then, came from white
                  farmers who sought to consolidate their position, for although
                  they were the main pillar of economy in the 1920s, their
                  position was by no means secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main reason for this was the lack of a viable staple crop,
                  hence they still had reason to fear competition from the
                  Africans who were also cultivating maize, and who, if given an
                  opportunity, could do so at far lower cost of production than
                  could whites.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They were also alive to the fact that should Africans purchase
                  land in their midst, with easy access to markets and the
                  availability of good quality soil, their potential as
                  competitors would be vastly increased.
                </p>
                <p>
                  White farmers were also aware that the possibility of Africans
                  purchasing land in their midst was becoming a more feasible
                  proposition as their earning capacity increased.

                  The white farmers were the largest sector demanding
                  segregation; nevertheless, they were supported in this field
                  by the missionaries. The missionaries were opposed to Africans
                  coming under what they considered, in many cases, to be the
                  corrupt influence of the white sector of the economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Initially, the missionaries were of the opinion that Africans
                  were "uncivilised barbarians" who must be civilised at all
                  costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the 1920s, however, they came to realise that there were
                  many aspects of tribalism which were worth preserving. The
                  missionaries were of the opinion that attempts to assimilate
                  Africans into the white economy before they were ready, would
                  result in their adoption of many of the less desirable aspects
                  of the white sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the passage of the Land Apportionment Act, white farmers
                  had achieved their objectives. Africans were prevented from
                  purchasing land in potentially good farming areas, and they
                  were pushed into areas remote from markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, the clause giving Africans a six year period in
                  which to move into their own areas ensured the acceleration of
                  congestion therein, the consequent cessation of agricultural
                  competition and the concurrent necessity for Africans to seek
                  an alternative source of income through wage labor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It prevented wealthy Africans from purchasing land in areas in
                  close proximity to white farms, and the Purchase Areas ensured
                  that there would be no conflicting interests with whites:
                  their access to both railways and markets was restricted.

                  The creation of reserves was itself responsible for the

                  Increased use of the plough by African cultivators added to
                  existing problems. African farmers saw the plough as a
                  labor-saving device, and it was for this reason that many
                  adopted it so readily.

                  Use of the plough in the absence of improved methods of

                  Africans were correct in assuming that a light scratching of
                  the ground with a hoe was the most efficient method under
                  Southern Rhodesian climatic conditions. Indeed, by 1905, white
                  farmers were already questioning the wisdom of deep-ploughing.

                <p>
                  As early as 1905, then, many white settlers had seen the value
                  of the reasoning behind African methods of hoe cultivation.
                  Deep ploughing without accompanying cultivation of the land,

                  The most fertile soil was the top soil, and Africans therefore
                  saw no reason to plant crops deep in the ground.

                  They were shifting cultivators, and it was usually virgin
                  soils which they cultivated, thus the necessity for deep
                  ploughing was never experienced by them.

                    It now appears that under a system of shifting cultivation a
                    relatively sparse population was in ecological balance with
                    the environment. The problem today is that the environment
                    was changed.

                    Population has increased. European occupation has limited
                    the land supply available for shifting cultivation by
                    African producers. Nevertheless, many traditional methods
                    have persisted, taking a heavy toll on the soil. (<em

                  Thus, although shifting cultivation might have sufficed in the
                  late nineteenth century, the conditions which brought it into
                  existence no longer applied, and a new type of agriculture was
                  required.

                  As mentioned, the introduction of the plough increased the
                  deterioration of the land. African farmers had realised that
                  much time and effort could be saved by utilizing this
                  implement.

                    There is reckless ploughing â€¦. I know cases where single
                    natives plough sufficient land to reap 500 bags of grain
                    while he actually reaps 50 bags only. The cause of bad
                    ploughing is the want of proper clearing of the land, and
                    they plough at the beginning of the rains and again towards
                    the end of the season. The consequences are the shortage of
                    grazing grounds, and the destruction of roots and grass
                    which would retain the rainwater and moisture. (<em

                  Fields were not properly cleared before the plough was
                  applied, trees were left standing and the ground was ploughed
                  around them; the ground was not stumped or levelled, nor was
                  manure applied or land irrigated. Several NCs comment on this
                  misguided use of the plough and its effects,

                    It will be several years before the use of the plough by the
                    natives can be considered an improvement on their own method
                    of preparation of the soil for crops; the ploughing is in
                    most cases badly done especially in the lands where stumps
                    have been left and they very often select land to be turned
                    over by the plough just because there are no trees in it,
                    that would have been a waste of time to turn over with the
                    hoe. (<em>NAR CNC Annual Report 1929</em>)

                  <em>31st March, 1899:</em> There are very few cattle, sheep or
                  goats - The Natives would like to buy some. They say: "Money
                  is a nice thing to have but it does not breed like cows and
                  goats."

                  There is a large population. On the average three per hut,
                  altogether 11,403 (in the whole of Salisbury District). There
                  is very little crime, it is a little short of marvelous and

                <p>
                  <em>31st March, 1900:</em> Large swarms of locusts and rice
                  was a failure. Dysentery is still the prevailing disease.
                  Supply of labour would be doubled or trebled, if there were
                  cattle in the country which the natives could buy. The
                  population is now 12,684 in 69 kraals. Revenue Â£2,273. Tax was
                  paid very well and most of the money was paid in gold.

                <p>
                  An epidemic of smallpox broke out on the Eastern border around
                  October. 4,212 children were vaccinated. Very few adults
                  required vaccination, as they had inoculated themselves during
                  the last epidemic which passed through this country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>31st March, 1903:</em> Crops were so good that they did
                  not bother to reap the whole of it but left it standing on the
                  lands. The natives of this country are very subject to chest
                  conditions and lung complaints.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This I consider attributable to the fact the natives wear
                  overcoats and thick jackets all through the day, no matter how
                  hot it might be and after the sun begins to set, they will
                  strip themselves of everything with the exception of their
                  waist skins and sit and lie about in that state for the rest
                  of the night.

                <p>
                  The natives loathe work as much as ever, and in spite of all
                  advice and persuasion they prefer to idle in their kraals and
                  drink beer. A native will probably work for one or two months
                  and earn from 30 to 50 shillings. This will suffice to pay his
                  hut tax and buy everything he requires for the next 12 months
                  and he will retire to his kraal.

                  had been abducted by the Matabele but returned to Chinamhora

                  Had he noticed any changes in the "Reserve" during the last 70
