                  The custom is highly complex and there are considerable
                  variations in the practice of roora. At best all I can hope to
                  do is to provide a brief introduction to the subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ROORA?</strong><br />
                  Translation is always a difficult and imprecise process. The
                  Shona word, ‚Äúroora‚Äú, is generally rendered into English as
                  meaning either ‚Äúbride-price‚Äù or ‚Äúdowry‚Äú. However, these terms
                  do not adequately reflect either the process or function of
                  roora in Shona society. A more subtle and accurate rendering
                  of the meaning of roora is found in the Standard Shona
                  Dictionary. Here we find that, in the Shona language, ku-roora
                  means¬†to be a partner in a marriage transaction; to acquire a
                  wife by Shona custom
                </p>
                <p>
                  Roora should not be seen as a payment for the bride. Valuables
                  are given to the girl's family to legitimise the marriage. It
                  is also important to recognise that this is not something
                  which can be understood in isolation. Roora is just one
                  component in the rich fabric of Shona custom, which defines
                  and regulates the complex relationships between tribe, family
                  and individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>HOW ROORA IS DETERMINED</strong><br />
                  The first step in the process involves the selection of a
                  <em>munyai</em>, or messenger, whose function is to convey
                  news of the intended marriage to the family of the
                  bride-to-be. The <em>munyai</em> will either be a relative or
                  a close friend of the suitor. The manner in which the news is
                  conveyed to the woman's family may appear somewhat curious,
                  though anthropologists have speculated that it emerged from a
                  historical necessity. The <em>munyai</em> approaches the
                  village, finds himself a vantage point at a safe distance and
                  calls out <em>"Matsvakirai kuno!"</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is customary that any villagers, who may be within earshot,
                  will then chase away the <em>munyai</em> while attempting to
                  beat him with whips. Some time later the <em>munyai</em> will
                  be allowed to return to the village without fear of
                  chastisement. The family elders (this is normally the woman's
                  uncles, rather than her father) then meet to determine at what
                  level the roora should be set.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beer is brewed and shared to formalise the settlement. The
                  <em>munyai</em> then returns with the terms to the
                  groom-to-be. In rural Zimbabwe a man and his cattle are not
                  easily separated. They pull his plough, fertilise his fields
                  and give him security. It is not surprising then that the
                  major portion of roora will usually consist of a specified
                  number of cattle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Roora is one element of the process. Other gifts, blankets and
                  perhaps shoes, hats and suits for the woman's parents may also
                  be exchanged. The son-in-law will probably deliver these in
                  the short term. However it is not expected that he should
                  provide all the cattle immediately. Completing the process of
                  roora will most likely take the son-in-law a considerable
                  number of years.
                </p>

                  <strong
                    >ROORA IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY</strong
                  ><br />
                  There is a Shona proverb, which states:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>Mukwasha mukuyu, haaperi kudyiwa.</em> (The son-in-law
                    is a fig tree; he never stops being consumed.)
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The proverb is likely to be quoted by a munyai in the course
                  of the original roora negotiations or later by a
                  <em>mukwasha</em> bemoaning the ‚Äúdemands‚Äù of his
                  <em>tezvara</em> (father-in-law) for another instalment of
                  roora. The elders who receive roora and the young men who pay
                  roora tend to view the custom somewhat differently.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the modern era when the young men have a greater
                  appreciation than before of marriage customs in other parts of
                  the world, many of them see roora as either primitive or
                  out-of-date. The elders, on the other hand, profess the belief
                  that roora is a key strand in the fabric which is rural
                  Zimbabwean society.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many young girls see a man's willingness to pay substantial
                  roora as confirmation of his commitment to the marriage.
                  Others might regret that the new family unit is being
                  established already burdened with a semi-permanent and
                  substantial debt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In practice the custom of roora is concerned with far more
                  than simply the transfer of material goods between the two
                  families. Roora plays a fundamental role in defining the
                  relationships between the two families and, in particular, the
                  levels of respect, which are due between various members of
                  each family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN PRACTICE?</strong><br />
                  Cattle were traditionally paid not simply to the head of the
                  family of the girl, but to the family group, and were normally
                  reserved for the marriage exchanges of the young men in the
                  group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Roora paid for her make their marriages possible, and a man
                  can expect special hospitality from his wife's brother's wife
                  who is married with the cattle he originally paid.‚ÄùConversely
                  younger brothers owe their married sisters a high degree of
                  respect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Why do young men continue to pay roora? Under traditional
                  customary law, roora is mandatory. A man's children only
                  belong to him after he pays roora. If a woman died while
                  living with a man before he paid roora for her, he had no
                  right to bury her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>THE WEDDING</strong><br />
                  As in most Shona ceremonies, the custom took the form of a
                  feast, where beer and meat were in ample supply for the large
                  numbers of people who gathered as witnesses. Its preparation
                  took many days and the actual marriage rites lasted at least
                  half a day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On these occasions, many of the male relatives of the couple
                  made speeches which were long, full of rhetoric and colorful
                  phrases, and often produced fascinating evocations of the
                  tribe's past. But they could also be monotonous, for most
                  speakers repeatedly emphasized those qualities essential to a
                  happy married life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was another of those occasions when people, as a duty and
                  an entertainment, gave themselves the freedom and immunity to
                  speak frankly about anyone they pleased. Anyone could eulogize
                  or abuse the bride or the bridegroom or both, saying openly
                  what they knew of the personal characters of the couple who
                  were receiving the sanction of the tribe to live together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The silent and defenseless victims were put in the dock of the
                  tribal <em>dare</em> and could be accused of being naggers,
                  liars, misers or lechers. It might be laziness or insobriety ‚Äî
                  no vice was left out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was a solemn occasion and no one attempted to introduce a
                  touch of humour into their pontifical speeches. The reason for
                  this public hearing was to bring it home to the couple that
                  they should embark on this most difficult of human
                  relationships with a reformed spirit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They were reminded of the problems of married life, of the
                  temptations which threatened marital stability and of the
                  binding nature of their union, whatever its burdens,
                  particularly as old age and responsibility took their toll,
                  and they were urged not to forget that since the white man had
                  taken control of our land, moral values had deteriorated to
                  allow licentiousness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The western idea that people getting married should be made to
                  feel happy and beyond reproach was far from the minds of the
                  speakers. Well-wishers they certainly were, but in a very
                  different sense from those of white societies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Africans reasoned that this was the moment of truth, for
                  it was in the truth about themselves that the couple would
                  discover real happiness. They did not appreciate the romantic
                  view of Europeans that a man and woman should be left to
                  discover each other after they had taken their vows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They should be warned so that once married, neither of them
                  should have cause to express shock or surprise about the
                  other.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of this indulgence, usually towards sunset, beer
                  was poured on the heads of the bride and bridegroom and they
                  were considered to have been properly married.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The proceedings were so heavy with ritual that it was clear
                  that the couple would have to be very courageous to come back
                  and ask the tribe to absolve them of their vows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>ELOPEMENT</strong><br />
                  It is customary that the procedures for marriage are
                  instituted after the woman has given a token or pledge
                  (<em>nhumbi</em>), or in other cases, after the man and woman
                  have given each other a pledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Should she, however, have sexual relations with the male
                  before the marriage, payments have to be made to her guardian
                  and the first thing she must do is to advise her father's
                  sister (<em>vatete</em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The woman now leaves for her lover's home without the
                  knowledge of her parents, but should her father know of the
                  despoilment he might ask the vatete (his sister) to take her
                  there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The woman need not yet be pregnant. It is accepted that when a
                  woman is found, say, in the bush with a man even during the
                  daytime, sufficiently strong suspicions may be aroused for her
                  to be reported to her father and she is consequently driven to
                  the man's home through the vatete urging her to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this form of elopement (<em>kutiza mukumbo</em>) it is held
                  that if the woman had not been in love with the man she would
                  not have known his home and it is doubtful that she would have
                  entered his home if she did not have any association with the
                  man.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If it were a distant home where the man lives it is held that
                  the woman must have known about the man's home and that she
                  must have gained the transport fare to go there on her own
                  accord.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the woman goes to her lover's home on the advice of her
                  vatete, she remains there with him and a certain amount of
                  money is paid by his father to the woman's father through a
                  go-between.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This payment is known as the <em>tsvakirai pano</em> ("you can
                  find your daughter here") and might be said to correspond to
                  the payment called <em>muromo</em> in the preliminary payments
                  made in a normal marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The object of the payment is to indicate to the woman's father
                  the he should not worry about his daughter's absence as she is
                  safe and that the man is prepared to meet his demands and
                  marry her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>tezvara</em> (father of the woman) now states what he
                  wants in the amount of bridewealth (<em>pfuma</em>). The
                  <em>tsvakirai pano</em> is brought in the evening to the home
                  of the woman by a go-between (<em>munyai</em>), or any other
                  trusted person, who is directed to throw it into the hut where
                  the mother is, or at the door if the hut is shut.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After throwing it, he must move away quickly lest he be caught
                  and beaten, he being regarded as a <em>mbavha</em> (thief). As
                  he leaves unnoticed and when at a safe distance away and
                  without fear of being overtaken, he shouts out alone
                  "Tsvakirai pano!", which is to say "Look for your daughter
                  this way" or he can shout out
                  <em>"Badza remhere iro!"</em> ("There you have the deposit for
                  the offense").
                </p>
                <p>
                  Should the <em>tsvakirai pano</em> not be paid instantly, a
                  fine is instituted when the man returns the woman to her own
                  house. This procedure is called <em>kupereka</em> (to return).
                  It is now that the <em>tezvara</em> demands this money, plus
                  an additional fine for the neglect of paying the
                  <em>tsvakirai pano</em>.
