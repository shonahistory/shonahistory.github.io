                  Where they are kicked in the belly is the place to which they

                  A duiker is one of a species If it bears a child, he will have

                  A brook is a river, when crossing you tuck in your clothes; A
                  humble disposition is required to overcome difficulties
                </p>

                  blanket. If he puts on a woolen one, it gets burnt; Misfortune

                  What is yours is yours; when you dip a morsel of sadza, you

                  A stone is a heavy thing for those who are afar; those who are
                  near treat it as a plaything; A chief is respected by

                  Genuine yawns belong to the child; those of an adult betoken
                  food; Children are ingenuous, adults devious. They convey
                  their meanings, for example when complaining, in an indirect

                  What is shared out equally is hair. Wealth is not shared out
                  equally; People, though sharing a common nature, differ in
                  their natural gifts and in their outlook

                  The one at peace is the one who is dead As for the living, a

                  It is cooperation while you are still setting the trap But as
                  for going to inspect it, there is only one person; A man seeks
