                <p>
                  Like marriage and birth, the death of a person is surrounded
                  by ritual, much of which has come down to the present day.
                  When a person died in the days of long ago, his body was
                  washed carefully by the wife or wives, helped by the son of
                  his brother.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    A dying man is expected to reveal the whereabouts of any
                    hidden resources, arrange for the settlement of outstanding
                    debts, and to confess any outstanding offenses against
                    members of the community. He may be given traditional
                    medicines to make his passing easier.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In many areas, people sing and dance in honour of the deceased
                  outside the room in which the corpse is lying: the songs
                  express the merits of the deceased and the grief of the
                  community. This may go on throughout the night if burial is to
                  be deferred to the morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The body was then placed on a mat in the man's hut, and
                  wrapped in a bark fibre cloth. After washing the corpse, and
                  plugging the body orifices with bark fibre, an appropriate
                  relative (the relationship varying with local custom) is
                  appointed to choose and mark the site for the grave.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A small cave or cleft in a rocky outcrop may be chosen, or the
                  soft damp soil by a river bed or in an ant heap. The site is
                  normally within a couple of kilometers of the homestead of the
                  deceased.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the site has been chosen, relatives and friends of the
                  deceased prepare the grave: a grave dug in soil is normally
                  dug to a depth of six feet and then an inlet is dug out to
                  take the corpse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The direct members of the family then built a stretcher on
                  which the corpse would be carried to the grave, simply wrapped
                  in a clean white cloth. In some areas, the task of cutting
                  poles and bark to make the bier is the task of sons-in-law to
                  the family of the deceased.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The body is often carried around the homestead in a last
                  farewell before the funeral procession sets off briskly
                  towards the grave. Young children are not allowed to take
                  part: they used to be shut away in a hut or granary for fear
                  that sight of the corpse would make them blind, but now people
                  do not bother too much â€” they say that since the coming of the
                  white people it does not matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gifts were then brought by the relatives of the dead man, and
                  farewells were made, before the body being placed on the
                  stretcher and carried in procession to the grave where it was
                  buried. On the way to the grave, the close female relatives
                  would run ahead of the stretcher, fling themselves on the
                  ground and cry out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In central Shona country, tension is often relieved by the
                  antics of one or more ritual friends (<em>sahwira</em>) who
                  are honoured guests at the funeral, and who have a permanent
                  joking relationship with the deceased and his or her family. A
                  <em>sahwira</em> may freely make fun of the immediate
                  relatives of the deceased, and so break the intensity of
                  mourning by introducing a certain amount of laughter into the
                  proceedings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona believe in flexed burials, and the body is placed in
                  a flexed position in the grave, the knees bent and the arms
                  folded across the chest. The most suitable place for a grave
                  is considered to be an anthill.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Normally the corpse is buried within twenty-four hours of
                  death. In the case of a chief or headman, however, it lies in
                  state for a longer period in order that representatives of the
                  deceased's children can pay their last respects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the body is placed in the grave, the relatives throw
                  soil in, and meat and beer are placed by the graveside. Later,
                  a form of wake is held at the dead man's village.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Burial is not the end of the death ceremony, however. Between
                  one and two years later comes the ceremony of
                  <em>kurova guva</em>, literally "to beat the grave". A
                  procession is once more made to the graveside, with the women
                  mourners running ahead as before and throwing themselves on
                  the ground, and great note is made of whether the pots which
                  were left by the grave have been in any way damaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If they have been so damaged, it is an indication that one of
                  the close relatives of the dead has committed adultery within
                  the prescribed period after death, and reparation must be
                  made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An offering of beer is placed on the grave, and it is an
                  occasion for feasting. At this stage, if the dead man's widow
                  so wishes it, she may offer a gourd of beer to her living
                  brother-in-law, as a sign that she is prepared to marry him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this way many widows are "inherited" by their
                  brothers-in-law, who will then also inherit the goods and
                  chattels of the dead man. Nothing personal belonging to the
                  deceased should be available for use until after the
                  inheritance ceremony.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Graves are always avoided except for ritual purposes, and
                  mingled with the fear of death is a fear of the occult powers
                  which are believed to linger around any grave. Thus a case of
                  madness in a small boy may be attributed to his stumbling
                  across a grave while herding cattle in the veld, and other
                  mishaps may be attributed to the proximity of graves.
