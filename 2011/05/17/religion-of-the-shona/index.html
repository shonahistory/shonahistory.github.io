                <p>
                  Anyone who studies the Shona religion will soon discover that
                  he is dealing with a deeply religious people. So complex and
                  developed in fact is this cult that one day the Shona religion
                  may come to be accepted as a form of monotheism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona admit a Creator, an omnipotent spirit whom they call
                  Mwari, Chikare or Musikavanhu. The Christian faith, like that
                  of the Shona, has its own great spirits like the angels and
                  the different saints who can be appealed to and from whom help
                  and comfort can be sought.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, whereas the Christian approaches God
                  directly, this is not the case with the Shona. They do not
                  pray to God himself but always contact the lesser spirits,
                  who, living as they do in the spiritual world, are in
                  communication with all the other spirits including God.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mwari has made them all and everything in this world, the good
                  and the bad. God is responsible for the good ancestral spirits
                  as well as those of the evil ones. Therefore it is much better
                  to appeal and place one's trust in the good spirits in the
                  first instance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona believe that their tutelary spirits
                  (<em>mhondoro</em>) can prevent and facilitate the fall of
                  rain, that their <em>vadzimu</em>
                  (family spirits) can cause sickness and that they can protect
                  them from harm, sickness and from a witch entering their
                  homes. When they pray in order to ask for something they do
                  not address God directly but pray to the spirits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Music is an important element in the inducement of possession.
                  Special tunes of a lively tempo are played to the medium. The
                  most usual instruments employed in Mashonaland are musical
                  gourds (mbira) and drums. The medium or mediums as well as the
                  congregants join in the dancing which goes on for minutes or
                  for several hours until the possession takes place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even an onlooker is carried away by the swift rhythm, the
                  patter of bare feet on the ground and the shrill cries of the
                  women. The whole ritual dance is very entertaining and the
                  physical efforts so hypnotic that all who take part seem to be
                  borne away towards the spiritual world. The living and the
                  departed are all joined in unison.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona show no concern over retribution in the world to
                  come. Punishment for ritual offenses is meted out in this
                  world. Once a person dies, no matter what his record on earth,
                  his spirit does not suffer in the next world, except by being
                  forgotten by the living. Shona ceremonies are not complicated;
                  they are easy to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No elaborate setting is required for services. No church or
                  ornate building is required. If prayers are to be made to the
                  family spirit (<em>mudzimu</em>) these are said before the
                  <em>rukuva</em> (pot shelf) in the main hut (<em>imba</em>) of
                  the family. They are very much a family affair with the family
                  spirits close at hand in the home. Even their graves are just
                  outside the family village. No special day is set aside for
                  prayers to the ancestral spirits of the family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most Shona who have had experience of western teachings
                  maintain that it is more comforting and real to pray to their
                  ancestral spirits than to a remote Creator. "Honour thy father
                  and thy mother" is a primary Shona commandment. Failure to
                  observe it will turn a beneficent mudzimu into an angry
                  <em>ngozi</em>. Inculcated too, is the interdependence of all
                  the members of the family and their ritual knits the family
                  closer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The importance of such a solid unit in a harsh menacing world
                  need hardly be emphasized. Even the modern Shona has
                  experienced the advantage in a difficult economic world of
                  knowing that he can rely on his family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So deep and close is the attachment of the Shona to the spirit
                  of his dead grandfather (<em>sekuru</em>) that he follows in
                  his footsteps throughout his life, believing it will please
                  his ancestors to live just as they did in the same village,
                  growing the same crops, wearing the same clothes and living in
                  the same huts, never changing or acquiring more than his
                  ancestors before him. The result is a compulsory uniformity, a
                  philosophy which tends to encourage normality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>WITCHCRAFT IN DAILY LIFE</strong><br />
                  Although a serious accusation is a comparatively rare
                  phenomenon among contemporary Shona, the belief in witchcraft
                  is very real and very strong. Many hamlets in the rural areas
                  and not a few urban homes are protected against witchcraft by
                  ritual and charms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Persons often wear charms and take medicines to protect
                  themselves from witchcraft. It can be argued that the Shona
                  believe there is a continual threat from persons endowed with
                  evil just as every European today accepts that we are
                  continually exposed to germs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The belief in witchcraft has an influence on attention to good
                  manners and etiquette. No one would want to show the unlikable
                  characteristics associated with a witch. Certain customs, such
                  as sharing food or eating and drinking from the same pot or
                  plate, reflect a fear of witchcraft or of being suspected of
                  witchcraft or sorcery: thus a traditional host should take a
                  taste of any food or drink offered to a guest,
                  <em>kubvisa uroyi</em>, "to take away witchcraft" (to show
                  that there is none).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also the fear that discarded property or anything coming from
                  the body could be used to bewitch a person results in a high
                  standard of cleanliness and hygiene.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Witchcraft beliefs act as a deterrent to crime. A man may be
                  afraid of picking up objects found lying around in case they
                  have been bewitched; this applies particularly to wandering
                  domestic animals which may have been involved in an exorcism
                  bringing evil and calamity to anyone who took possession of
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fear of being bewitched encourages good relations within a
                  community, and the fear of revenge or protective medicines
                  makes crime against members of the community seem dangerous
                  even when detection is escaped. Also a reluctance to wander
                  late at night for fear of being suspected of witchcraft or,
                  worse, for fear of meeting a witch on her nocturnal escapades,
                  minimizes the possibility of petty theft and like crimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It has been argued that witchcraft beliefs comprise a barrier
                  to material progress. A man who has significantly altered his
                  life style in accordance with technological and economic
                  advancement is endangered in two ways: he may readily be
                  suspected of using witchcraft to obtain the wealth necessary
                  for his change of life and, secondly, he is likely to arouse
                  envy and so become the victim of witchcraft or sorcery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A man who through hard work is slightly better off than the
                  common run is usually respected, but in a traditional
                  community there is little incentive to outstanding success,
                  and if it is achieved it should not be openly displayed and
                  flaunted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In communities which have had more contact with European ways,
                  however, people are not so afraid to stand out from the rest:
                  indeed this has become the ideal for most, but they must still
                  take precautions against jealous witchcraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In practice most communities have members who are conspicuous
                  for the material progress they have made, so belief in
                  witchcraft is not so much a barrier as a slight deterrent to
                  material progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona belief in witchcraft is also relevant to their
                  general reaction against the white people. Some of the older
                  people blame <em>chirungu</em> (meaning anything associated
                  with the whites) for the troubles of present times ranging
                  from bad crops and poverty to various social tensions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They base this vague and not always justifiable opinion on the
                  law preventing the conviction and punishment of witches who
                  are consequently believed to be more numerous and more free in
                  their activities than they were in the past and certainly some
                  people who foster the reputation they have as witches, flaunt
                  this freedom.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The actions of the <em>muroyi</em> (witch) can cause severe
                    illness in a person, and in some instances this illness is
                    induced by poison introduced into the victim's food or beer
                    by being carried in a fingernail and tapped over the edge of
                    the container. This poison, known as <em>chipotswa</em>, has
                    a rapid physical action, the victim becoming ill at once,
                    and vomiting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It also has a violent psychological effect; let a man
                    believe he has been fed <em>chipotswa</em>, and he will die
                    from fright as much as from the effects of the poison.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The nail used is that of the little finger on the left - the
                    unclean hand. The nail is allowed to grow to a great length,
                    so that it curls back slightly and makes a receptacle for a
                    powder. The accusation of witchcraft was made by the placing
                    of ashes on the doorstep of the accused. To disprove it was
                    a difficult and costly business.

                  <strong>WITCHCRAFT ERADICATION</strong><br />
                  There have been various attempts from outside Shona society to
                  eradicate the belief in witchcraft and the practices
                  associated with it. Prominent among these was the early
                  attempt by the colonial administration to eliminate
                  accusations of witchcraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The government was convinced that belief in witchcraft is
                  basically false and that the process of discovering and trying
                  witches through divination and ordeal is thoroughly
                  unreliable, often resulting in the conviction and punishment
                  of innocent persons: accordingly an ordinance was introduced
                  to convict any person who tries to injure another or his
                  property by means of witchcraft, and also any person who
                  imputes to another the use of non-natural means to cause
                  disease or injury to person or property.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The law was normally applied only against those who made
                  accusations of witchcraft: witches have escaped conviction,
                  even on some occasions when clear and concrete evidence of
                  witchcraft practice was produced against them. Although people
                  undoubtedly need to be protected from false accusations of
                  witchcraft, there is some justification for the Shona view
                  that the law provides protection for witches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Certainly the law has failed in its aim of diminishing
                  witchcraft beliefs. Besides government administrators, many
                  European missionaries have denied or ignored the Shona belief
                  in witchcraft and have forbidden their converts to take part
                  in associated practices. None of these measures have been
                  significantly successful in destroying the belief in
                  witchcraft, and the forbidden practices have on the whole
                  merely become clandestine.
                </p>

                  Within traditional African society there have been periodic
                  attempts to eradicate witchcraft, but these attempts have been
                  concerned with curing witches of their evil ways and in no way
                  question the validity of the common beliefs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One such attempt was made through the famous
                  <em>Mchape</em> movement in the 1930s, which originated in
                  Malawi and spread throughout central Africa. The agents of
                  this movement were young men, dressed in European clothes, who
                  claimed to be followers of the founder of the movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They would arrive in a village, assemble all the inhabitants,
                  give them a sermon on the evils of witchcraft and then line
                  them up for the witchcraft ritual. In this, witches were
                  allegedly detected with the aid of small mirrors and were
                  ordered to give up their hoards of harmful "medicines". If
                  they refused, the witch finders were reputed to find with
                  unfailing perspicacity where these medicines were hidden.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After detecting the witches, the witch finders proceeded to
                  cure them by giving each a sip of the famous mchape medicine
                  which, it was claimed, would cause any witch who returned to
                  her evil ways to die. It was believed that any witch who
                  escaped detection by refusing to pass in front of the magic
                  mirror would be caught and exposed at a second coming of the
                  founder of the movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, the witch finders sold protective charms against
                  witchcraft. Although from the point of view of the officials
                  this movement may have been primarily a money-making racket,
                  for the people who welcomed it (including many Shona
                  communities) it was an opportunity to rid the community of the
                  troubles and tensions associated with witchcraft. They were
                  ready to pay well for such an utopian situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There have also been a number of lesser movements acting in
                  different ways but to achieve the same end. The Mai Chaza
                  Church is a quasi religious movement named after its founder
                  who was said to have come back from the dead to cleanse the
                  country of witchcraft. The movement started in the early
                  1950s; it was popular in central Shona country for 10 years
                  until the death of the founder, and it still has some
                  adherents today.

                  The officials wear a uniform for ritual occasions at which
                  they cure witches. Witches are invited to confess their
                  witchcraft and to throw away all their charms into a pit; an
                  official of the movement (in the old days usually the founder
                  herself) cures witches by touching each and sprinkling her
                  with consecrated water.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many people traveled spontaneously to a cult centre to be
                  cured of their witchcraft, and many communities got temporary
                  relief from suspicions of witchcraft through the activities of
                  this movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now prophets of the new independent Christian churches are
                  often asked to cleanse a community of witchcraft. A prophet
                  might be invited into a homestead, where he finds hidden
                  medicines and charms in and around the houses and "sees" any
                  witch in the community. He destroys the charms and exorcises
                  the witches, usually by commanding the evil spirit to leave
                  its host in the tradition of the Christian gospels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The attitude of the independent churches towards witchcraft is
                  one of the reasons for their popularity vis-a-vis the mission
                  churches: as the Shona people explain, you can belong to a
                  mission church and still be a witch, but you cannot be at once
                  a member of an independent church and a practising witch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Witchcraft is considered to be the worst evil in Shona
                  society, involving deliberate harm to members of a community,
                  and yet it is ignored in the moral teachings of most mission
                  churches, which claim to emphasize love of one's neighbor as a
                  cardinal value.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, even in a changing situation, the Shona remain convinced
                  of the real evils of witchcraft, and they wish to be free of
                  these evils. Especially in times of tension and stress in a
                  community when suspicions of malevolence readily arise,
                  members of the community may take active steps in the wishful
                  hope that they can rid themselves of witchcraft and the evils
                  associated with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the state of supposed freedom from witchcraft cannot last
                  long. Even in the congregation of a church which emphasizes
                  eradication of witchcraft, members of the congregation are
                  believed to lapse occasionally into the practice of witchcraft
                  and have to be cleansed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No utopian ideal can eliminate the evils of disease and death,
                  or social conflict and frustration in a community. From the
                  Shona point of view, these evils are evidence of the practice
                  of witchcraft, so no eradication of witchcraft can endure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>NEW RELIGIONS</strong><br />
                  The God of Christianity is concerned with the details of the
                  lives of all men and dictates a moral code that all must obey,
                  whatever their race or tribe. Christianity thus provides a
                  religion that stretches beyond the limiting boundaries of
                  kinship group or chiefdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is a significant change from traditional religion which
                  was little concerned with what we would call ethics. It is
                  concerned primarily with respect for spirit guardians, and has
                  very little to say on people's relations with strangers or
                  anyone outside their communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the Shona break out of their small local communities and
                  have dealings with an ever widening society, many have joined
                  the various mission churches, to the effect that in 1974 about
                  seventeen per cent of the black population claimed some
                  affiliation to one or other of them and a further eight per
                  cent belonged to the numerous new independent churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The overall figures show that Shona religion has been
                  significantly affected by the advent of Christianity. Some
                  families have now been Christian for a number of generations.
                  The highly paid teaching posts in church schools were often
                  reserved for church members. So many Shona have become at
                  least nominal Christians, either through education or in order
                  to be able to profit financially from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In spite of the advantages offered by the Christian churches,
                  adherence to orthodox Christianity poses a number of serious
                  problems. The most significant arise from the fact that most
                  missionaries either ignore or deny the powers of ancestral
                  spirits and of witchcraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a man and his family are in good health, spirit elders
                  and witches may be forgotten in the face of a new religion,
                  especially if its preachers show themselves capable of rapidly
                  curing minor ailments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But should the new medicine fail, or should some serious or
                  permanent trouble his the family, traditional spiritual powers
                  are not so easily put out of mind and a new Christian may
                  readily fear that the he has incurred the displeasure of his
                  ancestors. It is difficult in such a situation to refrain from
                  reverting, at least temporarily, to traditional religious
                  practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona often remark that their rituals in honour of
                  deceased relatives are essentially similar to the European
                  practice of putting flowers on a grave on, for example, the
                  anniversary of the death of a close relative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some missionaries appreciate this point and have made attempts
                  to incorporate traditional respect for deceased ancestors into
                  their Christian rituals, but most regard traditional religion
                  as the antithesis of Christianity and adamantly refuse to
                  admit any influence from the traditional reverence of
                  ancestral spirits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In practice, many Christians believe in the power of
                  witchcraft and of their ancestral spirits and see no conflict
                  between these beliefs and official church doctrines, though
                  they may accept that church discipline prevents them from
                  meddling with these powers and prudence may dictate that they
                  do not speak about them to church authorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed an exclusively orthodox body of belief seems relatively
                  unimportant to the Shona and one often finds a casual mixing
                  of the tenets of different faiths. They do not find it
                  extraordinary to find a professed Christian who claims to heal
                  by the power of God and who also obtains help and advice from
                  a traditional spirit medium.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As one traditionalist who also believed in Jesus and in the
                  Holy Spirit explained, "It is best to believe it all."

                  <strong>NEW INDEPENDENT CHURCHES</strong><br />
                  Christian views on marriage have provided another stumbling
                  block for many would-be Christians. Firstly, there is the
                  problem of understanding the nature of Christian marriage.
                  White missionaries usually regard marriage as a sacred union
                  between husband and wife, in some cases an indissoluble union,
                  which is enacted through a religious rite. This rite creates
                  the union with all the rights and duties it involves: in
                  particular, sexual intercourse is licit only after the
                  marriage ceremony.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Central to Shona marriage is the payment of bride-price for
                  the right to children, negotiated possibly over a number of
                  years. Many Shona are not prepared to go into a monogamous
                  marriage, especially if there is no possibility of subsequent
                  divorce, without first ascertaining that the proposed wife can
                  bear children. The result is that many enter a church marriage
                  only after the birth of the first child, a practice that
                  conflicts with the morals taught by the churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instead of being central to marriage, a church ceremony is to
                  the Shona often merely an extra rite in the long process of
                  marriage, the central feature of which remains the negotiation
                  of bride-price payments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then there is polygamy. A man may want a second wife simply
                  for status, or because a single aging wife is not sexually
                  satisfying, or to provide more labour for his farm. At the
                  death of a brother he may find himself under obligation to
                  take responsibility for the deceased's widow and family, in
                  which case in Shona eyes she becomes a second wife to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whatever the reason, many men find the insistence of Christian
                  missionaries on monogamy too restrictive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In spite of difficulties, many Shona retain their membership
                  of Christian missionary churches through deep conviction and
                  staunch faith. Others have foregone attractions held out by
                  missionary bodies to maintain piously the traditions of their
                  ancestors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And there are those who retain their church membership for
                  reasons of convenience and prestige, and many others after
                  dabbling in Christianity have returned to their traditional
                  religion. Others still have found an intermediate form of
                  religion in the new independent churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shona labour migrants working on the mines in South Africa in
                  the early years of this century met new African independent
                  churches which were growing out of contacts with similar
                  movements among American negroes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On their return to Zimbabwe, some founded independent churches
                  in their home communities, mostly in southern Shona country.
                  The movement did not gain much momentum until the 1930s when
                  the independent churches, which had acquired by now a
                  character distinct from that of their South African
                  counterparts, began to multiply and to spread throughout Shona
                  country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a church acquires a following and grows in size, fission is
                  likely to take place with sections hiving off to found new
                  churches. Fission is often the result of conflicts over
                  leadership, which become most acute at the death of the
                  founder of a church, when his principal assistants are likely
                  to vie with each other and with the sons of the founder to
                  succeed to his position of leadership; but at any stage a
                  church official with a large personal following might break
                  away from the church to which he belongs and start his own
                  sect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now there are hundreds of independent churches or sects in
                  Zimbabwe with a total following in the order of half a
                  million. The churches vary considerably in size. The largest
                  is the
                  <em>African Apostolic Church of Johane Marange</em> (whose
                  members are commonly known as Vapostori â€” "Apostles") with
                  over fifty thousand members in Zimbabwe and half as many again
                  in neighboring territories. A smaller church may extend no
                  further than the neighborhood of its founder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The churches also vary in kind. The most common and most
                  popular are the "spirit-type" churches, which emphasize
                  inspiration and revelation by the Holy Spirit. Prophecy under
                  the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is a dominant feature in
                  these churches and the phenomenon of speaking in tongues is
                  common.

                  Another central feature in most spirit-type churches is
                  faith-healing. Historically, these churches are related to the
                  "Zionist" movement in South Africa and ultimately to Zion
                  City, Illinois, in the United States of America.

                <p>
                  The names of the spirit-type churches usually refer to Zion or
                  to the Apostles in order to establish an ideological
                  association between the new independent churches and the
                  founding of Christianity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A number of independent church leaders broke away from the
                  mission churches to which they had belonged after a clash with
                  mission authorities or on account of frustrated ambition to
                  positions of leadership within the mission churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A situation favorable to conflict and independence is created
                  by the contradiction between love for all men taught by the
                  missionaries and the poor treatment that their African
                  congregations received from the white community as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The realization that the expensive education of the missions
                  does not bring rapid advancement and the practice of racial
                  discrimination on the part of missionaries themselves
                  reinforced the climate of opinion favorable to independent
                  churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the Bible became readily available to the Shona in their
                  vernacular, and as more and more of the Shona learnt to read,
                  they became less dependent on the white missionaries for a
                  knowledge of the Bible. In particular the accounts of many of
                  the Old Testament figures with their numerous wives and
                  concubines belie the insistence of white missionaries on
                  monogamy. A desire to preach and apply interpretations more in
                  accordance with traditional Shona values is another reason for
                  the rise of independent churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another factor which attracts followers to independent
                  churches is their ritual. This applies particularly to
                  spirit-type churches with their music, the emotional out
                  pourings of the Holy Spirit and their colorful uniforms for
                  the different ranks of members, all of which contrast sharply
                  with the austere services of some of the Protestant
                  denominations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The attraction of the gift of prophecy in these churches can
                  be understood in terms of the parallels between prophets and
                  traditional Shona spirit mediums. Some prophets borrow much
                  from traditional rituals of spirit possession, speaking in the
                  lilting voice typical of lion spirit mediums and uttering
                  groans, sighs and other sounds associated with lion spirits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A prophet when possessed by the Holy Spirit may twitch and
                  shake as possessed mediums do. When he begins his prophecy, a
                  prophet may utter an incomprehensible jumble of names and
                  phrases from the Bible just as a medium at the beginning of a
                  stance may utter a jumble of names from the traditional
                  history of the chiefdom to which he belongs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the institution of prophecy the Shona find something
                  closely allied to, and a substitute for, their traditional
                  spirit mediumship. Apart from the ritual surrounding prophecy,
                  the activities of some prophets closely parallel those of
                  traditional spirit mediums.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As one aspect of communicating with the spirit world, some
                  prophets acquire a reputation for divining. Their field is
                  more limited than that of traditional diviners since they do
                  not co-operate with communications from ancestral spirits. But
                  many claim to be able to discern witches, and occasionally a
                  prophet may be called into a hamlet or village to expose all
                  witches in it and to seek out and destroy their secret
                  medicines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes too a party may consult a prophet of repute to
                  decide on a case of suspected adultery. The prophet becomes
                  possessed by the Holy Spirit through whose power he is
                  supposed to be able to see the miscreant. A number of prophets
                  also acquire reputations as faith-healers together with the
                  large clienteles which a reputation for healing naturally
                  brings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Akin to prophecy, the Holy Spirit is believed to bestow on
                  certain people (including most prophets) the gifts of
                  "speaking in tongues". At the services of spirit-type
                  churches, a number of people may enter into a kind of trance,
                  partly induced by the rhythmic singing and the emotional
                  preaching and praying of the assembly, in which they jabber in
                  incomprehensible "tongues".
                </p>
                <p>
                  The phenomenon to some extent replaces spirit possession on
                  such traditional occasions as a dance in honour of alien
                  <em>mashave</em> spirits, when a number of people may become
                  possessed without any serious mediation from the spirit world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These churches accept that the spirits of the dead can
                  influence the physical world, especially to cause sickness,
                  and they certainly accept the belief in the evil influence of
                  witchcraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But they maintain that spirits which cause sickness are evil
                  spirits whose power can be overcome by faith in God. Thus if a
                  man believes himself to be troubled by a spirit which wants to
                  possess him and accordingly he asks for help from the church
                  officials, they do not deny his explanation of his trouble as
                  a white missionary is likely to do; instead they accept his
                  understanding of the situation with all the implied anxieties,
                  and they perform a rite to exorcise the spirit by the power of
                  the Christian God.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They offer a way of coping with sickness and trouble that is
                  in accordance with the traditional Shona understanding of the
                  world and yet purports to transcend it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As one man who lived in the vicinity of a Roman Catholic
                  mission remarked,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The "Apostles" are better than Roman Catholics: you can be a
                    Catholic and at the same time a witch, but you cannot be an
                    "Apostle" and a witch.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The popular independent churches have managed to combine
                  traditional ways of thinking and acting with the new
                  international religion based on a high god who cares for all
                  people and who can be approached by anyone. They are thus well
                  able to cope with the transition from traditional tribal
                  communities to contact with the wider international world.

                  <strong>THE AFRICAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH OF JOHANE MARANGE</strong
                  ><br />
                  One independent church stands out as the most popular and
                  widespread in Zimbabwe. Also known as the Church of the
                  Apostles, whose members are commonly known as Vapostori
                  ("Apostles").
                </p>
                <p>
                  The founder of the church, Johane Marange, was born in 1912,
                  the grandson (on his mother's side) of a chief. Johane
                  attended four years of schooling at a Methodist mission, where
                  he was baptized into the church. While still a boy, he started
                  having dreams and visions, the most important of which are
                  recorded in the <em>Umboo utsva hwavaPostori</em>, regarded by
                  the "Apostles" as a canonical addition to the Bible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the book of his visions, Johane claims to have received a
                  full charter for his church with all its rules and practices
                  through the direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The news of
                  his revelation spread rapidly through his extended family to
                  others in the neighborhood and at the first sabbath meeting,
                  only three days after the revelation, about one hundred and
                  fifty people were baptized into the church at a nearby river.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ceremony took place amid chanting, speaking in tongues,
                  and exorcisms. Some of the new members were consecrated to
                  offices: evangelists, prophets, healers and an elderly judge
                  (Johane's father) to settle the domestic disputes of church
                  members.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The key positions were given to relatives of Johane who became
                  senior figures in the more detailed hierarchical structure of
                  the church which was elaborated (reputedly under directions of
                  repeated revelations to the founder) as the church grew in
                  size.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The new church quickly came out against traditional religious
                  practices, associating ancestral spirits with evil demons.
                  Johane's father killed without ritual the bull dedicated to
                  his spirit ancestors, and his mother, a senior spirit medium,
                  burnt her regalia. She however, after some oscillation between
                  traditional religion and her son's church, finally broke with
                  the church to continue to practice as a diviner and the medium
                  to a senior spirit of her father's chiefdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were two early schisms within the church. One of the
                  earliest evangelists broke away with a small personal
                  following, and later a senior prophet-healer broke away with
                  some local support after a conflict over the use of church
                  funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A more serious schism took place in 1963, shortly after the
                  founder's death. There followed a struggle between Johane's
                  elder brother and his maternal relatives who had held
                  positions of leadership within the church. One of the latter,
                  Simon, who claimed he had always been second to Johane in the
                  church hierarchy, was suspected by some people of bewitching
                  the founder in order to take over his position in the church
                  (the two were traveling together immediately before the
                  founder's death).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the end, the traditional rule of inheritance won the day
                  and Johane's sons succeeded to the key positions in the church
                  with Johane's elder brother (their 'great father') maintaining
                  his influence. The two senior sons also inherited two
                  Landrovers for their official church visiting, an arrangement
                  which Simon's followers opposed on the grounds that they were
                  church property and not part of Johane's personal estate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the elder brother tried to manoeuver Simon and his son
                  out of office and ordered a change of venue of the annual
                  Paseka ceremony from its traditional site near Simon's home,
                  Simon took his grievances to the chiefs court. The chief
                  evaded the issues by allowing Simon to found his own church,
                  which he did reluctantly; it became a refuge for any who were
                  dissatisfied with the organization of the principal body.

                  The 'Apostles' set themselves apart from their neighbors in
                  many ways. On Saturday afternoons they don their church
                  uniforms for the sabbath service. For girls and women this is
                  usually simply a white veil tied to the head with a red
                  ribbon. The men wear white tunics, each with an embroidered
                  decoration including a badge indicating the person's office in
                  the church; men also carry long wooden staffs, wear their
                  beards long and shave their heads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All go barefooted at a service. 'Apostles' may not drink
                  alcohol, nor smoke tobacco, nor may they eat pork. They may
                  take no part in the rituals of traditional Shona religion and
                  they taboo traditional musical instruments which are used at
                  these.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They may not use any medicines, neither traditional nor
                  European; some would rather die than receive medicinal
                  treatment, though a temporary lapse from the church in order
                  to receive medical treatment in times of severe sickness may
                  be readily condoned. When 'Apostles' have functions to perform
                  at traditional rituals by virtue of kinship or friendship,
                  they usually find pagan acquaintances to stand in for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  'Apostles' may temporarily leave their church while seeking
                  treatment for disease, whether from a mission hospital or from
                  a traditional healer, and a person may become a temporary
                  member of a spirit-type church while seeking a cure.
