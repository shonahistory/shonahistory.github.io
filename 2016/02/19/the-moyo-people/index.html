              <p class="author">&nbsp;</p>
              <div class="entry">
                <p>
                  The Rozvi, like many other groups, say that they came from a
                  land called <em>Guruuswa</em> and from a place called
                  <em>Manyanga</em>. Like the Tembo they moved at first to a
                  place north-west of this country. Their traditions tell us
                  that they were accompanied on their travels by a voice which
                  they called Tovela which led them on their way, keeping them
                  safe from dangerous places.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The voice could speak from any object it chose and we are told
                  that it spoke through grass or trees or even through a little
                  child unable as yet to speak for itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The voice was the voice of a presence whom some say was the
                  first Rozvi ever created, the founding father of the clan.
                  Others say he was the first person ever to be created and that
                  after his death his spirit accompanied the different groups
                  from Guruuswa to the countries they chose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tovela not only protected his people on their travels but gave
                  them food as well. When they clapped in homage and
                  supplication to him at a tree, portions of porridge, pots of
                  milk, and combs of honey would come out of the ground. He also
                  gave them medicines to become invisible but not inaudible to
                  their foes and to be long lived.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tovela came to be called by other names by different groups
                  such as <em>Mwari</em>, who is the ancestral spirit of every
                  one of the people, <em>Manyusa</em> (the one who made food
                  emerge from the ground), <em>Muwanikwa</em> and
                  <em>Mutangakugara</em> (the first to exist),
                  <em>Mupawose</em> (the one generous to all),
                  <em>Mbuya</em> (the one as generous and loving as a man's
                  grandmother), <em>Samasimba</em> (the one with all authority),
                  and <em>Hidzivachepo</em> (the original one, lit. the original
                  pool)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mwari and Tovela were the names the Rozvi used for their
                  guardian spirit. They also had names for the Creator, for
                  example, <em>Murenga</em>, a name which would be uttered when
                  they sighted an animal they could eat. Tradition says they
                  would exclaim "<em>Komborera, Murenga</em>!" and the animal
                  would fall dead. The people would then use it for relish.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the Rozvi reached this country they found Munhumutapa
                  ruling it. They attacked him and drove him away. This was the
                  first fight in which they had ever engaged. After
                  Munhumutapa's flight, they subdued all the chiefs who had been
                  subject to him. They are said first to have gone north, to
                  Pfura, then east, to Nyanga, then south to Manyika and Bikita,
                  and finally west, to Mberengwa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tradition explains that the name Rozvi was given to them
                  because they disturbed the lives of everyone, man and beast
                  alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All this is said to have happened under the rule of the first
                  chief whom they remember , called Changamire. He had thirty
                  wives, many of whom were daughters of the people he subdued in
                  this country, and many children. His eldest son was called
                  Rowanika, though there are variant forms of his name, such as
                  <em>Marowanyika</em> and <em>Mawananyika</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On his father's death, there was so much insensate rivalry for
                  the succession that he was alarmed and fled to the north, to a
                  place on the Zambezi called Chinanga. His disappearance
                  brought some of his brothers to their senses and they followed
                  him to try and persuade him to be the new king. However, they
                  never found him as he had crossed the Zambezi.

                  The man chosen to succeed Changamire, therefore, was the son
                  next in seniority, called Nechasike. Of him nothing is related
                  save that he begat many children. After his death the throne
                  was inherited by Tombo whose full name in Rozvi was
                  <em>Tombo-laikona-chimwango-chimuroyi-chaMavengeni</em> (The
                  rock unharmed by the worthless hoe, the witchcraft of the one
                  who hates me). The name was a boast that all the chiefs of the
                  land had been subdued and not one remained bold enough to
                  challenge the conquerors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nechadzike, alias Nechapingura, succeeded Tombo. He is
                  remembered for his attempts to tame elephants and use them to
                  work, a plan which did not succeed. The next king was Bhasvi,
                  alias <em>Rupanda-manhanga-hupenga</em> (Desire for pumpkins
                  is madness). He is remembered as having been an evil and cruel
                  man as the following story will illustrate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He sowed millet in his royal field and had his people to weed
                  and reap it. when the grain was reaped he gathered it together
                  on a threshing floor of rock but never had it threshed. This
                  he did for three years, allowing the grain to accumulate from
                  year to year. They were years of plenty for both chief and
                  people. They thought that Bhasvi was leaving the millet,
                  reaped from the royal field, as a charm to ensure plentiful
                  crops. But after the harvest in the third year he set the
                  grain on fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such wanton behavior the people could not understand. But
                  three years of famine followed Bhasvi's deed. The people were
                  angry with what he had done and wanted to kill him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bhasvi however, died of his own ailments and was succeeded by
                  Mutinhima, alias <em>Gumbo-levhula</em>. He is said to have
                  lived at Dzimbahwe. After his death Lembeu succeeded. His full
                  praise name was
                  <em>Lembeu-Kurima-kwakona Mutengieni-wazvozvovenga</em> (Eat
                  your seeds. Ploughing is impossible. The sour plum tree has
                  come crashing down). He was a good farmer but did not achieve
                  the fame of Bhasvi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chirisamhuru came next but by this time the power of the Rozvi
                  had been weakened. The reason for this is that their guardian
                  spirit who used to speak to them, namely, Tovela or Mwari, had
                  withdrawn his voice and presence from the people, angry at the
                  way people and stock had been harassed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After Chirisamhuru his successors were Chiduku, Bhasvi the
                  second, Mbavha alias <em>Rozani</em> and Mambo. Chiduku was
                  the first of that name who lived when the Rozvi still drank
                  cow's urine and water still seeped out of the rock at
                  Dzimbahwe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the days of Mambo's reign there was a person called
                  Nyavanhu who had greater renown than Mambo himself. Mambo's
                  people persuaded him to send a force against Nyavanhu, playing
                  on his fears that he might be forced to become subject to his
                  new rival.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nyavanhu was attacked and his cattle and possessions taken and
                  joined to those of Mambo so that his cattle pens and barns
                  were overflowing. Now among the raiding party there was a
                  certain man called Tumbale. Tumbale was not a Rozvi by lineage
                  but was related to the Rozvi through his mother.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On his father's side he was a Mbire. He lived at Mambo's court
                  because he was his favorite nephew and also because he was the
                  chief's great diviner. He had become the leader of the Rozvi
                  in this respect now that Mwari had left them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>NHETEMBO</strong><br />
                  The nhetembo of the Nhohwe link the people of Mangwende to the
                  Rozvi. Their principal praise name, Muzukuru (sister's son),
                  proclaims what their relationship to the Rozvi is. On the
                  other hand an earlier link with the Nzou, Samanyanga is hinted
                  at by the praise name which is both in the introduction and
                  conclusion of the nhetembo, viz. Chirandu (Great Beast)
                </p>
                <p>
                  The praises refer in the usual complimentary fashion both to
                  ancestors and ancestral burial sites and to the qualities that
                  differentiate these people from others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The clan praises of the Rozvi recall their once extensive
                  power and wealth. In them the function of the praises as
                  propaganda and self-advertisement comes clearly to the fore.
                  The Moyo nhetembo are singular in using imagery based on a
                  domesticated animal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Nhohwe's founding father who led them from Chidema in the
                  north was Sakubvunza. The first home of the group who came
                  into these lands (<em>nyika dzino</em>) in the days of
                  Changamire was at the Jeta Hills, near Domboshava in the
                  present Chinamhora Tribal Trust Lands. Sakubvunza, however,
                  coveted the country of Nhohwe under the Rozvi chief Nyamhunga
                  and he invaded it, driving the latter to the country called
                  Maungwe in present-day Rusape. He also coveted the country of
                  Sokoto and would have driven out its occupant, Chikomovi, had
                  not the Rozvi overlord, Mambo, intervened and Chikomovi became
                  tributary to Sakubvunza.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The chiefs who succeeded Sakubvunza in the Mangwende
                  Chieftainship were: Gatsi, Mungati, Monyera, Dembetembe, Gatsi
                  II, Rota, Mhotani and Katerere. It was during the reign of
                  Gatsi II that the Swazi invaded the realm and destroyed the
                  Rozvi power, expelling the Portuguese traders from their forts
                  and fairs as well. Mhotani lived at Chitopi on the Nyakambiri
                  River, a site that figures in the nhetembo. The burial place
                  for the chiefs is the hill called Maseyekwa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Nhohwe were given the totem Moyo by their Rozvi uncles,
                  their sisters having married Nhohwe men. They were also given
                  the chidawo <em>Muzukuru</em> to differentiate them. They were
                  known as <em>vana vehanzvadzi dzavaRozvi</em> (children of the
                  sisters of the Rozvi). Like the Rozvi they abstain from the
                  meat of the heart. The term VaMoyo (Sweetheart) may be used as
                  an endearment by a man to a woman of any clan.
