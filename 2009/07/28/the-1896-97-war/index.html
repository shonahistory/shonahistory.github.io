                  Although several months have now elapsed since the public was
                  thrilled and horrified by the accounts of the late Matabele
                  and Mashona rising, I feel bold enough to think that the
                  following narrative, in which I can now say I was lucky enough
                  to play a part, may be of some interest to my friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I left England for Mashonaland in August, 1894, and therefore
                  had had some little experience of the country previous to this
                  war. Before beginning my story I propose to mention just a few
                  events that led up to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sometime in March, 1896, information reached Salisbury
                  (Capital of Rhodesia) that the natives in Matabeleland had
                  revolted, that several murders had already taken place and
                  grave doubts were expressed as to the safety of the people
                  residing in the outlying districts, doubts which unfortunately
                  too soon proved to be well founded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By April things had assumed such serious aspects that it was
                  decided by the Chartered Company to send at once a detachment
                  of the Horse Volunteers from Salisbury to Bulawayo. 140 men
                  left on April 12th.

                  <figcaption>
                    The revolt caused a panic in Bulawayo, and a laager was
                    formed around the market hall. Here the settlers waited
                    while outside the marauding Matabele burned the farms and
                    wrecked the crops and mines

                  The distance between these two towns is about 300 miles and as
                  nearly half the men, through the scarcity of horses, were
                  "<abbr

                    >footsloggers</abbr
                  >" it may easily be understood it took some time to accomplish
                  this journey, more especially as rinderpest was raging in the
                  country in such a way that no less than 150 out of 200 trek
                  oxen were lost en route.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Column had not been long away when grave signs of
                  discontent were visible among our own Africans, the Mashonas,
                  but it was not until Sunday 31st May that anything like revolt
                  occurred. News was brought into town that day that a man named
                  Dougherty had been killed in the Lomagundi District by being
                  thrown down a shaft, and large pieces of rock and stone had
                  been found piled on top of his body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the same time natives in the employ of a white man had been
                  found murdered, but no further act of hostility was
                  encountered until a fortnight later and, in the meantime, the
                  Government (B.S.A. Co.) was reposing in complacent confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 15th June, news reached town that two miners named Tait and
                  Koeford had been killed at the Beatrice Mine by a body of
                  natives supposed then to be Matabeles; the weapons used were
                  knobkerries and four of the natives employed by these white
                  men had also fallen victims.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 17th June, the town was again startled by the news of the
                  death of a man named Stunt, a prospector, who was killed on
                  his way out to the Hartley District and later on came the news
                  of two more men falling victims.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this point grave fears were felt for the safety of Mr. and
                  Mrs. Norton and their household who were residing at a farm
                  some 18 miles from town on the Manyame River.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These fears were somewhat allayed by the appearance during the
                  day of Mr. Talbot, one of the men living there with them, and
                  who was destined to be the only survivor of that ill-fated
                  party.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He had ridden in to report to the Native Department that all
                  the natives employed on the farm had run away and assistance
                  was required to bring them back, otherwise all was well. When
                  Talbot returned that night he found no trace of Norton, his
                  wife, child, nurse or assistants but there was evidence of a
                  fearful struggle in one of the huts and the floor was covered
                  with blood.

                  He immediately returned to Salisbury and brought in the news
                  just as the whole community was at fever heat with excitement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 18th June, a mass meeting was held in the Market Hall and
                  by 12 o'clock every man in the place was there to meet the
                  representatives of the Government (B.S.A. Co.) and see what
                  steps were going to be taken to provide for the safety of the
                  inhabitants in the town.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I need hardly say the meeting was one of the most
                  extraordinary and exciting that it has ever been my lot to
                  witness. Anxiety and responsibility together with indignation
                  were visible in every face.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Invectives were freely thrown out on all sides against the
                  Government on account of the stolid indifference they had
                  displayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A Defence Committee was ultimately organised which undertook
                  to protect the town and the women and children. It was further
                  agreed that every man should turn up that night at the
                  Barracks to do picket duty round the town if required and two
                  small patrols were arranged to go to the outlying districts
                  and bring in or give notice to the people living there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first one consisting of five men was sent to the Mutoko
                  District to give warning to the Native Commissioner out there
                  but they never reached their destination and after one or two
                  narrow escapes ultimately took refuge at the Jesuit Fathers'
                  farm situated some nine miles from Salisbury.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second one was sent to the Mazowe District where it was
                  known some 14 men and three women were in laager.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The van arrived safely and met with no opposition on the road
                  but it was considered by all advisable to start back at once
                  as rumours had reached there that a large
                  <abbr
                    style="user-select: none"
                    tip="a body of Matabele warriors brought together in a barracks at about 18-20 years old. The group developed a strong identity as a regiment thanks to insignia such as the patterning on their shields. Each impi had its own kraal of cattle, and the king assigned each a specific hide patterning"
                    >impi</abbr
                  >
                  was on its way to that district; therefore a start was made as
                  soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first detachment consisted of Dickenson, Cass, Faull,
                  Pascoe, Fairbairn and Stoddart and they took with them two
                  donkeys, a cart and Mashona carriers, being followed later by
                  a second party with the van.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All went well until they got about three miles from the Mazowe
                  Camp, here the natives started firing at them, and to quote
                  Mr. Fairbairn's report on seeing some natives striking
                  something on the ground with their knobkerries one of their
                  carriers was sent to see what it was and he returned saying â€”
                  <em>"Fundisi is felie"</em> meaning "Missionary Cass is dead".
                </p>
                <p>
                  Immediately after this Dickenson was shot dead. Several more
                  Africans appeared on the ridge a short distance off and on
                  them opening fire the 14 carriers threw down their loads and
                  disappeared.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The party then decided to go back to the Camp but scarcely had
                  they turned their cart than Faull who was driving was shot
                  through the heart by a native concealed in the grass, he,
                  however, bit the dust three seconds after, being shot almost
                  instantly by Fairbairn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Africans still kept following them up and succeeded in
                  shooting one of the donkeys which compelled them to leave the
                  cart and make the rest of their way on foot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They soon met the van containing three women and accompanied
                  by the rest of the men who on hearing the news decided to
                  return at once to the laager at the Mazowe Camp.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before reaching their destination they were fired at from all
                  sides and no less than 50 natives came out of the grass quite
                  close to their rear and seemed for the moment intent on
                  rushing them. However, by constantly firing and urging on the
                  mules, they were able to reach the rough laager on the Kopje
                  at the Camp having lost three men killed in their attempt to
                  come in.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A desultory fire was still kept up by the natives on the
                  laager and the women were obliged to crouch behind the rocks
                  for shelter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shortly after this Blakiston, who was a telegraph mechanic but
                  not an operator, offered to go to the Telegraph Office (a hut
                  situated about 500 yards from the laager) if the telegraphist
                  would go also and send a message to Salisbury asking for
                  relief and describing the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They took a horse with them and reached the Office safely and
                  the message flashed through to Salisbury was,
                  <em
                    >"We are surrounded, send us help, this is our only chance,
                    goodbye".</em
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two minutes after sending this, both men and horse lay dead
                  about half way between the Telegraph Office and the laager.

                  All through that day and night the natives kept up a hot fire.
                  A Matabele who was evidently their leader posted himself
                  behind a rock about 400 yards off and by the way he splintered
                  the rocks in the laager each time he fired was undoubtedly the

                  He never exposed himself and all that was left for the
                  besieged to fire at was the barrel of his rifle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He evidently had a great idea of his personality as during the
                  evening he was heard to yell in his native tongue â€”
                  <em
                    >"I am a Matabele, why do you leave me without tobacco?"</em
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the night the Africans got within 150 yards of the
                  laager and although some of them were shot, things looked
                  terribly serious for the inmates. Nothing, however, occurred
                  and day at last dawned.

                    loaders into which they crammed almost anything that came
                    handy, pot legs and even stones, as some of the missiles

                  <strong>MARONDERA</strong><br />
                  It was on March 23rd, 1896, that the second Matabele War broke
                  out, but the vast majority of white people in Rhodesia never
                  imagined that trouble would spread from there to Mashonaland.
                  Their judgment, however, was soon proved to be faulty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There had been signs for those who were prepared to read them,
                  but many native commissioners, quite as much as other white
                  people who came into less direct contact with the Mashona,
                  refused to accept the evidence of their eyes and their
                  informants. However, by June, 1896, facts could not be
                  ignored; the Mashona had risen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Norton family was killed on Wednesday, June 17th, 1896. By
                  midday of the same day the news had reached Mahopo, the kopje
                  upon which Chief Mangwende had built his kraal. His son,
                  Mchemwa, and his brother, Gatsi, understood the message beaten
                  out from kraal to kraal by the drummers, and towards evening
                  fires blazed out from the hills of Nhowe and were answered by
                  similar fires on the far off hills of Goromonzi and Jeta.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When Ziute and Savidjgo came to Bernard Mizeki's home among
                  the buildings which Gouveia had once inhabited, they did not
                  come on the spur of the moment; for many weeks, even months,
                  there had been plotting and planning. And yet, although
                  Mchemwa waited for a message before letting his wrath loose on
                  the white men and those who befriended them, there was no
                  concerted African movement against the scattered European
                  population.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bernard Mizeki was dragged from his hut on Mchemwa's
                  instructions and mortally wounded late in the night of June
                  17th, but it was not until the 20th, however, that the rest of
                  Marondera felt the full impact of the war.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For three days, then, the Mashona stayed their hand, and the
                  tiny European population, quite unaware either of Bernard
                  Mizeki's death or of the possibility of a general uprising,
                  continued to trade and travel along the main road.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That Bernard Mizeki was the first casualty in the Marondera
                  area throws some interesting light on the causes of the war.
                  For what had incensed Mchemwa and the n'anga (witch-doctor)
                  was Bernard's attachment to the white man's church and his
                  traditions and beliefs, so much so that they believed he was
                  really a white man in disguise, hiding himself under a black
                  skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Molimile Molele, the Methodist catechist at the Nengubo
                  Mission, was disliked for the same reasons, and he too lost
                  his life in the war on account of his attachment to the white
                  people and their ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The oral evidence is quite clear on this point, and it finds
                  expression on two main fronts. The first, for the sake of
                  convenience, may be termed administrative, for the African
                  teachers had attempted to make the Government's instructions
                  understood. Mrs. Farrant noticed that
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Bernard visited the kraal on top of the hill whenever he
                    could in an attempt to interpret and justify to the chief
                    the actions of the Government
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  and Douglas Pelly wrote in March of a visit to Bernard Mizeki
                  that
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    our talk was chiefly of crops and cattle, and the future
                    actions of the Government.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The African teachers were equated with the Government and the
                  white men who controlled it, so that the African peoples
                  really came to believe that Bernard Mizeki's task, under the
                  guise of Christianity, was to snatch their children away from
                  them and convert them into white children.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The teachers were also held responsible, quite apart from the
                  hut tax and. demands for labour, for the terrible scourges of
                  locusts, rinderpest and drought which the white man was
                  alleged to have brought into the country. And this introduces
                  the second, major channel of discontent, the religious; for if
                  God failed to make it rain, was He not angry at those Africans
                  who had turned away from the traditional spirits?
                </p>
                <p>
                  In its baldest form, this opposition is expressed by old Mrs
                  Mangachema:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Molele had provoked them by telling them to leave the
                    mudzimu
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  but individual complaints concerning monogamy, the killing of
                  twins and so on also divided the powerful leaders of
                  traditional African religion from the new, white-led religion.
                  Unless one or other was going to give way, there was bound to
                  be a conflict, especially since religion in Shona society held
                  such an important and long-standing position.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus those men who assisted the white men, whether in
                  Governmental duties and explanations or religious observances,
                  were clearly assisting in breaking down the traditional fabric
                  of African life, which others were so keen to uphold.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The reason why the Reverend Molele and the rest were killed
                    was because they were said to be keeping foreigners, and
                    they wanted to destroy Nengubo because he had accepted the
                    Missionary.

                  These statements sum up the fusion of administrative and
                  religious forces which prompted the people of Nhowe to kill
                  Bernard Mizeki and the people of Chizengeni to murder Molimile
                  Molele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is not the place, however, to discuss the complex causes
                  of the Mashona war. But the reasons for the murders of Mizeki
                  and Molele, both men of great courage and Christian
                  principles, indicate that the war was something much less
                  superficial than a Matabele-directed expression of discontent.
                  It was a genuine national revolt such as every invading people
                  must expect, when they come to live in another's land with any
                  degree of permanence.

                  <strong>A BRUTAL WAR</strong><br />
                  The war was not a well-organised movement nor was the strategy
                  coordinated. Bernard Mikezi was killed on the Wednesday night;
                  nothing happened after that event until the Saturday, when the
                  Africans moved towards Mendamu farm. Still more strange is the
                  story of the European man who lived near Mchemwa's kraal on
                  Mahopo, and yet had no experience of the war until first light
                  on the Sunday.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He had only been on his farm a few weeks, and was unwilling to
                  leave his new home. At dawn on the Sunday, an African, perhaps
                  one of the messengers, Jan, or perhaps the cook-boy, Simon,
                  went to urge him to make for the Marondera hotel immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The man demurred; his mind was soon made up, however, when a
                  number of Africans, led by Mangwende's son Mchemwa, appeared
                  from over the neighboring kopje's crest and came running
                  towards the homestead, not concealing their hostile intent. He
                  seized his rifle and made for the bush at a fast pace.

                <p>
                  There then ensued a thrilling race between the European and
                  his African companion on one side, firing back at their
                  pursuers from time to time, and Mchemwa's band on the other
                  side. The two managed to reach the hotel, exhausted and
                  unharmed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the hotel preparations were being made all night for the
                  escape. They prepared three wagons from those which had
                  arrived at the hotel on Friday to take some of the ammunition
                  back along the Fort Charter road to Matabeleland. At least
                  these had mules, and not oxen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were nine European men gathered at the hotel. Exactly
                  who the men were is not known. Whoever they were, they were
                  off early on the Sunday morning. The Africans who had watched
                  the preparation, assumed the party would make for Salisbury,
                  and they blocked the main road to the west accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This bad misjudgment gave the Europeans a chance to gain a
                  slight lead and be through the narrow nek which lies to the
                  east of the hotel and into more open country before
                  Marondera's men could stop them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not without alarms, the racing convoy continued to keep ahead
                  of the Africans, and the mules, which had been driven flat
                  out, were changed after 16 miles at the old stables, and soon
                  the party was on its way again, keeping a sharp look-out for
                  the enemy; but they never came close nor made any concerted
                  attack upon the wagons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After these first exciting days Marondera subsided into
                  complete inactivity. No white man remained in the area. The
                  Europeans in the rest of Mashonaland found themselves in the
                  same predicament as those in Matabeleland, surrounded, as they
                  were, by hostile Africans and short of provisions. They badly
                  needed food as well as military assistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the 28th of July, a column of the Matabeleland Relief Force
                  came to the Ruzawi River. The crossing lay beneath Mangondo, a
                  series of kopjes among which Chief Sadza had built his village
                  and where Selous had been entertained many years before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was quite a different reception which these men now
                  received. But organised gunfire drove the Mashona back into
                  the recesses of the kopjes, and members of the relief column
                  followed them with gay abandon, exploring the huts, catching
                  chickens and collecting fowls, for they had been told in
                  Bulawayo that the Mashona would not show fight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The loud report of the elephant gun, or family gun as it was
                  more usually called, disabused them of that idea, and for some
                  time desultory fire continued between the inhabitants of the
                  kopjes and the relief force.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was only one entrance to the agglomeration of petty
                  caves which honeycombed the rocky mass and that was defended
                  from the inside by the Mashona, amply supplied with
                  <em>family guns</em> and copper wire, stones, old pots, broken
                  bottles and even bullets as ammunition. It would be a bloody
                  process to force the entrance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the beginning of August the supply of food for Salisbury
                  was so dangerously low that a message was sent requesting the
                  Infantry to collect grain from the kraals in the Marondera
                  neighborhood. With this aim, the bulk of the Mounted Infantry
                  set off early on the 10th for Gatsi's kraal which they found
                  deserted, its inhabitants having removed themselves into the
                  numerous caves which abounded there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One African, however, was captured and he was used as a
                  go-between with Chief Gatsi. He was lowered through a cleft in
                  the rocks on a rope and a parley took place between Gatsi and
                  his advisers underground and the whites above. Not much
                  progress was made for Gatsi, like Mchemwa his arrogant nephew,
                  had no intention of giving himself up to white men without a
                  real struggle.

                  But while these fruitless negotiations were going on, a
                  Lieutenant Barnes, in his search for stored grain,
                  incautiously put his head into a crevasse already occupied by
                  a manned tower musket, and the boom of the familiar family gun
                  told its own sad story.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After Barnes's death, the Europeans no longer felt like
                  negotiating. The solid rocks and the running streams made the
                  Gatsi caves an ideal retreat, and although the Mounted
                  Infantry attempted to smoke the Africans out, they had no
                  success, and were forced to move on, having gained no grain,
                  but having lost an officer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And so they went to Mahopo instead, to the kraal of Chief
                  Mangwende. But he had gone, and his grain with him, to the
                  Bogoto Mountains to the north, while Mchemwa and his followers
                  had left for Nyameni and the terrain under Chief Marondera's
                  suzerainty to the south. All that remained was a large
                  Portuguese flag, which Gouveia had given the chief a decade
                  earlier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Soon after midnight on the 2nd of October, Captain Pease led
                  out 40 men of the Mutare Volunteers, who had just arrived from
                  the eastern districts, and 30 men of the Matabeleland Relief
                  Force in a southerly direction. They marched about ten miles
                  before attacking a well-fortified, but uninhabited, kraal
                  belonging to the sub-chief Chiwara.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Africans had already got wind of their coming, and had
                  moved off to Manyabira's, a less well-fortified village, but
                  better provided for defensive purposes, for it was sited on
                  some flat rocks through which the river ran, and beneath which
                  were some caves amply provided with water.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The beastliness of the war had only just begun. Pease's troops
                  withdrew 100 yards from the rocky fastness and shelled it with
                  their seven-pounder, but to no avail. The early lessons were
                  now bearing fruit, for it became abundantly clear that only
                  dynamite would move the Africans from their lairs, and a
                  message was sent to Mutare asking for explosives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a week they tried smoking the Mashona out, but this,
                  too, was unsuccessful. At last the dynamite arrived. Three 10
                  lb. charges were put down, but they elicited no response. Then
                  a whole case was put down. This produced an enormous explosion
                  with a dull flash in the midst of a great volume of smoke,
                  which cleared to show that the caves had been markedly altered
                  in shape.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    After a long wait, the women and children came out, and
                    awful sights they were. The cave was evidently a small one
                    and. they had been thrown against the rocks and were all
                    covered with blood and the dynamite had skinned them or
                    burned the skin off their bodies.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  But even this was not the end. For the men refused to
                  surrender; they shouted defiance and continued to take pot
                  shots at anyone in their line of fire. So three whole cases of
                  dynamite were put down into the cave, and the whole complex
                  was utterly destroyed, the rocks disintegrating or subsiding
                  and the bodies being hurled, mutilated and lifeless, in all
                  directions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such was the fighting which the terrain and the African
                  determination dictated. It was repeated again and again, at
                  Gatsi's and Svosve's just as at Manyabira's, where the
                  ultimate death toll could never be known.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Mashona's endurance and determination was astonishing; for
                  they only rarely attacked, and then only in very favourable
                  circumstances, but allowed themselves to be trapped in
                  positions which were secure against the Matabele, but not
                  against the white man's dynamite, there to await death usually
                  in the most horrible circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For twelve months this went on in the Marondera district. The
                  Mashona retreated to their rocky defences, where the odds were
                  stacked against them, to meet their destruction, and only
                  infrequently did the dull thud of the family gun mark a
                  marginal success for them with the death of an Imperial
                  trooper.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The return to Gatsi's kraal on October 24th began a repeat
                  performance of what had occurred at Manyabira's. For the
                  previous week the neighboring kraals had been cleared out, on
                  one day no fewer than eight kraals being burnt before
                  breakfast at 10, and their inhabitants gathered at Gatsi's
                  kraal, beneath which lay enormous caves and running water.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The kraal itself was rushed and the Mashona fled into the
                  caves; the seven-pounder, doing more damage to the fowls than
                  the Africans, and some dynamite made no effect, for the caves
                  were large enough, airy enough and sufficiently well-watered
                  to cater for all the men gathered there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For nearly a week the undisciplined troops remained, shooting
                  indiscriminately, looting and joking. It was this lack of
                  discipline which was responsible for the death of the
                  Commanding Officer, Major Evans. His death was a particular
                  tragedy, because he had married only two days before he set
                  sail to Central Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He was much loved by his troops, who shed tears at his
                  untimely death, and he was buried in the Ruzawi cemetery early
                  the following morning. There was a 24 hour lull while the
                  funeral took place, but once that was over the business of
                  ejecting Gatsi and his followers from the caves continued.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The women and children, having been warned of the impending
                  use of dynamite, came out, but the men remained, unrepentant
                  and unbowed. Finally, 2,000 lbs. of dynamite were set off at
                  once, and the same havoc, the same misery, the same ultimate
                  success repeated itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Slowly, then, the district was being cleared and, although
                  some chieftains refused to give up, many began to move away
                  from their old homes, as Mangwende had done, travelling north
                  into the Murehwa district or east into the empty lands of
                  Chihota, or, as some of Svosve's followers had done, south
                  into the Hwedza area.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Expeditions still went out all through October to dislodge the
                  Mashona from their natural fortresses in which they had
                  gathered, to Svosve's in the south, as well as Gatsi's in the
                  north.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The approach of the rainy season heralded important activities
                  on a more general scale. By December, patrols had swept clear
                  in a great circle, inflicting defeats on most of the chiefs
                  they had met, while the road to Mutare along the watershed was
                  also clear; Mutasa had come down off the fence; Makoni was
                  dead, though his son remained hostile among the rocky terrain
                  to the north of Rusape; Marondera's, Gatsi's and Mangwende's
                  homes were destroyed, and those who remained at large were
                  being driven further away from the main road and their
                  traditional homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the time the rains were coming to an end, the Police in
                  Marondera were faced with only one major problem, and that was
                  the defeat of Svosve and his henchmen. To the north and west,
                  the war had virtually ceased to be. It was only in the unknown
                  area to the south-east, where
                  <a
                    href="./../../../../2014/07/26/karanga-traditional-medicine/index.html"

                  >
                  had trekked across in 1872, that it continued to flourish.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Patrols were repeatedly sent out after Chief Svosve, who
                  remained with some, but not all, of his followers in the rocky
                  plateau where the Svosve Reserve is now. On April 14th a
                  patrol of 24 Mutare Volunteers went into Svosve's lands, and
                  was there attacked, one private being killed and two other men
                  injured; patrols were sent out into the same area on April
                  17th, May 26th and again on June 19th, but on all these
                  occasions it was the volunteers who attacked, not without some
                  minor casualties, and the Mashona reverted to a purely
                  defensive attitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Svosve himself had been captured, but some of his young
                  headmen continued the struggle to the bitter end. But the
                  struggle became less keen and less universally supported as
                  the long odds against an African victory began to be
                  understood, so that by the end of July the war began to peter
                  out, and headmen were surrendering to the Native Commissioner
                  and giving up their arms. Many of these were clearly the
                  purchase price for 'old workings' paid by the early-day
                  prospectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was a number of Martini-Henry rifles and some
                  Lee-Metfords, which had been gained as loot at the beginning
                  of the war but had not been used much because of the
                  difficulty in getting hold of ammunition, as well as the
                  inevitable elephant gun and other strange armaments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The followers of Mangwende were driven away from Mahopo and
                  their traditional garden lands towards the north, where the
                  Mangwende Reserve is now situated. In the south, Svosve's
                  followers drifted down to the Sabi River and can be found in
                  the Hwedza Reserve, although the rocky bastion of the present
                  Svosve Reserve continues to be the home of some of the
                  descendants of Svosve's warriors of the 1890's.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this case, they were never completely defeated and driven
                  out. In the Chiota Reserve to the west, Chief Sadza can be
                  found, 20 or 30 miles away from the family home among the
                  kopjes called Mangondo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this way, the pattern of Land Apportionment finds some of
                  its roots in the war, and the Europeans' occupation of the
                  lines of communication was a natural sequel to the strategy
                  employed in 1896 and 1897.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is in this respect particularly that the war had a lasting
                  effect upon the history of Marondera. For it settled, by force
                  of arms, the area of European occupation and so laid the
                  foundations of the farming community of Marondera.

                    only ourselves to blame for defeat in the 1896 struggle. We
                    had begun the war with many advantages, but as time went on,
                    he would say, our stamina and resourcefulness dwindled to
                    such an extent that many of our people lost heart, went over
                    to the enemy and enabled the white man to flush our soldiers
