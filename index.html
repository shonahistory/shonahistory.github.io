                  The whole Shona way of life is geared towards dependence. The
                  Shona, being a realist, is aware of the uncertainty of life.
                  There are many hazards â€” disease, death, accident, drought and
                  famine; indeed at any moment misfortune may visit one or more
                  of the family kin. There was also the risk in earlier times of
                  attack by other tribes, notably the Matabele.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One lived in an unfriendly world and so it was a sine qua non
                  that in order to exist one could hardly fend for one's own but
                  the chances of survival were greatly enhanced if the family
                  stood together as a group, always ready to lend a hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Should one fall by the way, temporarily or permanently through
                  sickness, the family group would till the lands, herd the
                  cattle, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this subsistence economy there was no place or scope for
                  the individual. He was much more protected if he threw in his
                  lot with his blood relations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This desire to identify himself with his people is another
                  reason for conformity. If each has to depend on the other,
                  peace is more likely to reign in the group when all have more
                  or less the same activities and interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This desire is extended further into all other spheres not
                  only in dress, but also in house design and in the pattern of
                  architecture. One can expect that soon the manners will become
                  similar and stereotyped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Shona society there are few special positions or
                  professions open to people of skill or individuality. Perhaps
                  the most notable of all are the herbalist and mbira player,
                  and these occupations do earn for these people a position of
                  trust and regard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another position of status is the councillor of the chief and
                  there may be a few such men, specially selected by the chief,
                  who assist him with court work and perhaps the only other
                  position of authority is that wielded by the headman
                  (<em>sabhuku</em>) who is also appointed by the chief. He has
                  the responsibility of guarding the interests of the chief in
                  his group of villages and settling minor disputes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The contrast, however, between European society and African
                  society in the professions and trades open to men is quite
                  striking and the lack of skills and trades in African society
                  also tends to make men and their families equal in status.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It should not be thought however that all men and women are
                  equal and enjoy the same social status. The exceptions already
                  quoted do permit the <em>sabhuku</em> and the chief to better
                  themselves materially although these advantages are only
                  modest in extent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within this society itself, however, there exists a whole
                  hierarchial system of social differences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Special duties fall on the different relations and these
                  confer on them a special status which often gives power to a
                  particular individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The father has special rights over his wife and children and
                  the father and mother in turn have a special place of regard
                  with increasing age.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The grandparents are consulted on matters of procedure and,
                  not least, they train the grandchildren in manners.
                </p>

                  The father and mother-in-law are held in special awe and
                  respect by the family of the husband. The <em>tezvara</em>
                  (father-in-law) is not to be trifled with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are special ways in which the girl's family must be
                  received, and should her father die his younger brother, even
                  if only a young man or even a child, is to be shown the same
                  respect as if the father were alive. He will be given a
                  special place at the
                  <abbr
                    style="user-select: none"
                    tip="The place where the men eat their food"
                    >dare</abbr
                  >.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sisters of the father have special duties in the village,
                  particularly the youngest sister. She will be the intermediary
                  between the father's children when advice or permission on an
                  important matter such as a boy wanting permission to marry a
                  certain girl, and to her also falls the responsibility of
                  instructing a boy or girl before marriage on matters of sex
                  and marital procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also given a special place in the family circle is the
                  <em>muzukuru</em> (nephew or niece), the most important being
                  the eldest son of the eldest sister of the father. He has the
                  right to settle minor family squabbles and disagreements,
                  before others are called in.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>mukwasha</em> (son-in-law) too has certain specific
                  duties â€” some rather menial â€” at community gatherings. For
                  instance, it is his duty to skin the beast; it is also his
                  responsibility to gather the firewood on which the meat is to
                  be roasted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When he comes to stay at the home of his wife's parents, he
                  must prepare the fire at the <em>dare</em> and when he eats
                  there he may not sit in the company of his wife's father, but
                  with the young unmarried sons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The eldest son in the family has a position of status since he
                  will become the head of the family unit on his father's death
                  and he may act for his father when he is away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona have devised or introduced other practices which are
                  not easy to explain. Probably these customs too have as their
                  basis the object of keeping the family more closely linked.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, the "joking relationship" which exists between
                  the <em>varamu</em> who are the brothers-in-law or
                  sisters-in-law in two families concerned in a marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A brother-in-law is permitted to play, tease, fondle, hold and
                  become intimate (except in sexual matters) with his
                  brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law and vice versa. On the other
                  hand no intimacy is permitted between the kin of the same
                  blood relationship, nor between
                  <abbr
                    style="user-select: none"
                    tip="a blood relative, especially on the mother's side"
                    >cognates</abbr
                  >
                  of different generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The object of permitting the <em>varamu</em> to become so
                  friendly might be a protective measure to ensure that in the
                  event of death of the husband, the surviving spouse will have
                  established good and happy relations, so that one of them
                  would be more ready to take her and her dependents on in
                  marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One might also explain the ritual friendship
                  (<em>usahwira</em>) which is such a striking feature of Shona
                  life, on the need for support by others. The closely knit
                  family circle can be depended on to help a man or woman on the
                  many occasions when such help may be needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are exceptions however, as for example when outside
                  support would be better than that from within the family
                  group. There may be reasons for a man preferring to talk over
                  some important matter with a true and trusted friend. Such a
                  person could lend a helping hand when it would be preferable
                  not to rely on aid from his own relations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And so in traditional Shona circles each married man generally
                  has such a friend whom he knows will never let him down, who
                  will stand by him at all hours of need and who will never
                  doubt his cause up to the last day of his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In European society there is no such device or mechanism.
                  Among Europeans true and absolute friendships are few and far
                  between.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The dependence of men on each other is extended beyond their
                  immediate family circle to the much larger circle of the clan
                  in which they have the same totem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This close tie is exemplified by each clan having its own
                  totem, and is extremely strong among the Shona tribes today,
                  each man in his clan believing that he is related by blood to
                  all the men in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The clan typically occupies a defined area with strictly
                  defined boundaries under its chief who represents an offspring
                  of the original founder of the tribe by descent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He is the spiritual leader of the clan and all the agnates can
                  be regarded as his descendants. There must be a feeling of
                  security in having this agnatic group living together ready to
                  protect each other from outside attack and the whole group
                  looking upon itself as one large family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona declare that a happy and pleasant countenance is
                  desirable if one is to be on good terms with one's fellow men.
                  An unhappy or sour or unpleasant demeanor is apt to be linked
                  with the witch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore on the whole the tendency is towards the
                  encouragement of pleasurable activities both for the
                  individual in his daily life or in a group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is important for a wife not to seclude herself from others,
                  and whenever she is approached by another person, that she
                  should have a pleasant manner. There is no need to be
                  hilarious or friendly but rather to combine good behavior with
                  a pleasant countenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona do not hesitate to avail themselves of the
                  pleasurable sensations with which nature has endowed man. The
                  Shona take an intense interest in sex, thus in sexual matters
                  there appears to be little restraint in married life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would prefer to regard this as a feature of the Shona not to
                  interfere with the natural functions of life which excite the
                  feelings of love and pleasure and happiness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not that life is promiscuous; married life is sacred and it is
                  anti-social for either a man or woman to have sexual relations
                  unless properly married.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I might be able to link the habits of married life with the
                  Shona's constant and unusual pleasure taken in the communal
                  beer drinks.

                  The majority of Shona drink and from early life the children
                  are given sweet unfermented beer and attend parties with their
                  parents. But they accept that alcohol creates a pleasant
                  feeling when taken in moderation and he therefore encourages
                  social drinking as it would tend to make men happier, more
                  relaxed and would encourage better relationships with each
                  other.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However this does not follow always, for many people cannot
                  follow the normal course which is the object of this communal
                  form of social relationships.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A fair number suffer from an emotional instability which
                  becomes aggravated in the presence of alcohol while others
                  become addicted to drink and many of the homicides, injuries
                  and bad relationships occur as a consequence of these
                  occasions.

                  Alcohol is used for all ceremonies. Its pleasurable effects
                  are known and a congregation in a happy frame of mind is
                  preferred.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the many ceremonies I have attended the decorum of the
                  people was good, and the beer was always handed round in
                  accordance with procedure. Seldom was anyone in a state unfit
                  to attend.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mood was comparable to that seen at a European sundowner
                  party at which there is obviously much pleasure at the renewal
                  of acquaintanceship and the success of the affair seems to
                  revolve around the drinks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Take away the drinks and it would be hard to maintain this
                  social occasion.

                  Pleasure, too, in the form of a beer party is given to the
                  villagers when their gardens are weeded or ploughed or their
                  crops winnowed.

                  On these occasions of <em>maricho</em> each householder
                  invites his neighbors to come and lend a hand so that the task

                  The Shona encourage the pleasures of life if these are
                  provided by nature, so long as in the process of their
                  enjoyment no person is denied his share or is harmed in any

                    Hemp-smoking has been for centuries a common feature among
                    the Shona tribes. It is mentioned by Dos Santos who calls
                    the hemp
                    <em>bangue</em> and says that the people used to grind and
                    eat it, taking it with water, whereupon they could remain
                    without food for several days. It was more intoxicating than
                    their beer (<em>pombe</em>).

                  <p>
                    Monomotapa Gatsi Rusere (1597-1624) is said to have been a
                    passionate hemp-smoker and was nicknamed "Monomotapa
                    Bangueiro." The Karanga also used to smoke hemp after having
                    killed a lion or murdered a person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was imported all along the East Coast by Persian and
                    Indian traders. In Brazil hemp is known as
                    <em>bange</em> and was most likely carried there by the
                    Portuguese or by African slaves. Hemp smoking is also
                    mentioned in a Karanga tale about two friends who were both
                    called <em>Zinwa-mbanje</em> (he who drinks hemp).

                  I stress the need not to limit another person in the process,
                  for one continually meets the urbanized wife who protests
                  about the drinking habits of her husband because he fails in
                  his service to the family. Because of this the family income
                  is dissipated and the children are not provided with clothes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona appreciate the virtues of life. There is no quality
                  of goodness which is not accepted or encouraged in their
                  society. They are as conscious of the need for the correct
                  behavior as any race I know. In this respect they excel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed the more traditional the Shona the more noticeable are
                  these qualities. Many a visitor to the African villages In the
                  earlier part of this century has remarked on the exemplary
                  honesty displayed by them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One could, and still can leave articles of clothing or
                  valuables about with absolute safety in many of the reserves.
                  These will not be touched even though the African must know
                  that there is little chance of being detected if these wore
                  removed. Within their own society such honesty is equally well
                  observed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona do not know two standards. They know only one and it
                  is unfair to judge those Africans who have been removed from
                  this influence and, lacking in strict family ties and
                  discipline, have been allowed to become demoralised through
                  urban social factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By this I do not wish to imply that urbanisation is not a
                  necessary evolutionary process through which the African
                  people must pass. The clock cannot be put back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The point I wanted to make is that the rural Shona are
                  virtuous people. The rural villagers have no time for greed.
                  It Is not tolerated by them. Food in any case is hardly ever
                  plentiful and the one who is greedy must of necessity take
                  away from other hungry mouths.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A man must eat normally. He can eat till he is full and
                  satisfied but must neither take away from the stores nor eat
                  before his turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, in Shona society no person is permitted to eat alone.
                  it is antisocial. Every person must eat and share the meal
                  with his relations and friends living at the time in the
                  village. Table manners are equally important. Each child is
                  brought up to know when he can sit down to eat, where his
                  place in the eating group is, when he may rise, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He is made not to think of himself only, for there are others
                  in the world who have to be considered. Europeans sometimes
                  think that "the African is ever ready to take". When an
                  African is offered food or other items he usually accepts
                  gratefully the gifts because it is impolite to refuse
                  something offered to him. Further, it must be remembered that
                  most Africans are in need of what they find offered them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Great stress is placed by the Shona on telling the absolute
                  truth. I have repeatedly found evidence that they are a
                  truth-loving people. In my researches amongst them I have
                  never once been misled by my many sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This work was carried out in all parts of the country and I
                  had ample opportunity of checking and rechecking their
                  statements and time has shown that the information received
                  has been corroborated by other workers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What has struck me too is that if my sources refused to
                  divulge a certain matter they would say so and no one tried to
                  fabricate anything. People have felt that the African would
                  deliberately confuse me in my work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not so; they seemed to realise the importance of the work and
                  they did not deviate in telling me what was the truth. I
                  believe in this regard they are quite remarkable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In their traditional society only the truth is accepted and
                  encouraged as the only proper way to get on in the world.
                  Children are severely thrashed by their parents if they are
                  found lying for the Shona appreciate the chaos and unhappiness
                  that can happen in life if the truth is not practised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have stressed too how careful the Shona is in not showing
                  any sign of jealousy for this is a characteristic of the
                  witch. Anyone who earns such a reputation runs the serious
                  risk of being linked with witchcraft. Hence the importance in
                  traditional society for all to have the same possessions â€” for
                  it is the wealthy who provoke jealousy and in this way the man
                  who is rich is liable to be selected by the envious person.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is better to be the same as the others and in this way a
                  more peaceful existence can be assured. Although the Shona are
                  strongly opposed to any display of jealousy, they accept that
                  there arc those who are by nature jealous and it is from these
                  people that the witches are drawn. It is an hereditary trait
                  and in the case of the witch, she is possessed with a spirit
                  which exhibits a strong jealous nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona are moved by kindness. They appreciate it. Many a
                  European contends that the African does not appreciate what is
                  done for him. Very often it is the European who does not
                  realise that kindness is well understood by the recipient
                  because of language difficulties or some other way of
                  expressing his appreciation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed the African will not easily forget something which he
                  understands has been done for him. I constantly meet this in
                  my medical practice. Few patients openly come up to me and
                  thank me, for they find it difficult to express thanks to one
                  whose manners are different from theirs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it may be months or years later when I meet such a
                  patient, I find he is clearly very pleased to see me and I can
                  readily notice this in his reactions. Further, the African who
                  has been treated by me has always been ready to help me in my
                  researches into African customs. They could not have been more
                  helpful â€” all a token, I feel, of acknowledgement for what has
                  been done for them in the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Africans do not encourage begging and I believe I am right in
                  stating that we meet with very few beggars in their society.
                  There are exceptionally few of them as compared with what one
                  finds in a European city. On the other hand it is a fact that
                  in African society charitable bodies do not exist. The reason
                  for this was that no need existed for these in a society where
                  all are equal, enjoy the same opportunities even though the
                  scope is strictly limited.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is however, another reason for the absence of charitable
                  bodies. Charity often means mixing with strangers, with people
                  whose backgrounds are unknown. They may have been driven away
                  from their homes and wandered about and reach a strange
                  village in desperate straits. Therefore a real fear exists in
                  traditional society that by making contact with these people
                  evil may be brought into their midst.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is not that the Shona does not want to lend a helping hand.
                  What frightens him is that by befriending the stranger he may
                  expose his family to the evil people of this world. Therefore
                  he is always careful whom he befriends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No Shona mother will dare leave her child out of her sight for
                  a moment lest another woman who is a witch should become
                  intimate with her offspring and so taint it with her bad
                  influence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When greeting a stranger hands are not usually shaken but each
                  individual sits a short distance away and claps his own hands.
                  The inference is obvious.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona will go to great lengths to avoid giving offense as
                  he understands it. He respects those who are to be shown
                  respect and he will not deviate from this path. He knows from
                  the earliest days of his life that his father is not to be
                  trifled with. He is to be treated with awe and fear.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona has over the centuries made a close study of the
                  importance of controlling one's feelings and emotions, for
                  nothing is more liable to cause upset or offend than the
                  incorrect word or hasty move. By giving careful thought to any
                  matter, many an unhappy human relationship can be avoided and
                  friendly relations maintained.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And so the Shona have devised and introduced a number of
                  valuable procedures which are designed to keep emotions normal
                  and which will prevent people losing their tempers and so
                  committing an offense. Everything must be done to remove the
                  emotional or prejudicial viewpoint.
                </p>

                  These procedures inevitably cause delay and the onlooker may
                  be struck by what appears to be unusual tardiness and lack of
                  interest and enthusiasm. This is far from the case for he is
                  giving considerable thought to any problem. The deliberations
                  are purposely slow so that emotional upsets and consequently
                  bad friendships can be avoided at all costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Good normal behavior is thus established in their society. One
                  of the most certain ways of avoiding poor relationships with
                  others is to behave correctly towards the other person.
                  Manners will go a long way towards ensuring this and Shona
                  life is full of the many different procedures to bring this
                  into effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona have the nicest manners I have ever seen. They are
                  elaborate, thoughtful and in their traditional society this
                  must go a long way towards ensuring peace and goodwill.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have been struck, for instance, by the way a junior greets a
                  more senior man or woman. I have been impressed by the way a
                  woman greets a man and vice versa, and by the friendly words
                  or phrases employed when one Shona meets another. It is
                  practised as a continuous whole, and clearly every child is
                  well taught in its details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One could describe at length the beautiful manners shown by
                  the males and females when eating their food, and even when
                  taking the piece of stiff porridge from the plate. There are
                  rules laid down as to who is to eat first, and no boy dare
                  rise from the eating place until his father has completed his
                  meal. Instead he chews a piece of stiff porridge continuously
                  until the father has had his food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are also prescribed manners for the women who eat on
                  their own in the hut. There are many acts of courtesy and of
                  respect which are shown by the son-in-law towards the family
                  of his wife. These too have certain characteristics.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There is a special way of greeting a senior man, and of the
                  position men take up when sitting on the ground to discuss an
                  important matter. There are quite a number of different types
                  of hand clapping, some faster than others, others slow and
                  more sustained, some specially reserved for a chief or a very
                  important visitor, for an honoured man or woman in their
                  society, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are strict procedures laid down as to who should start
                  the conversation when people meet. There is the customary way
                  of meeting and addressing one's father and mother, and even
                  one special one of affection when a grandfather and
                  grandmother are greeted. Throughout the society there is a
                  common pattern. These manners are carried out automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Shona society the tasks and what is expected of any
                  individual no matter what his age or position in the family
                  are carefully laid down by custom. Everyone knows exactly what
                  the aunt does and what the eldest son is permitted to do. The
                  father's rights and privileges are laid down by tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are not likely to meet an upset in this society on this
                  score for everyone understands his position in the group. Nor
                  does this position vary within the clan or even in the more
                  extended tribal group.

                  At a beer drink when either the men or the women are waiting
                  for the cup to be passed round, there is a very well-defined
                  method of procedure adopted and no offense will ever be given
                  to the grandfather and father. I stress this care in procedure
                  or what might be referred to as family protocol because it
                  tends to avoid frustration and quarrels among all people and
                  ensure a calmer and more useful existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to maintain normal and healthy relationships with
                  one's fellow men one should avoid being rushed into taking any
                  hasty decision. Thus the African tends to be slow â€” he is
                  never rushed. He cannot keep to an appointment to the split
                  second like the European who constantly keeps looking at his
                  watch lest he be late. Ask Africans to meet at a stipulated
                  time and most of them will arrive some considerable time
                  after. Punctuality is not a feature of their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The same characteristic delay occurs if an answer is wanted.
                  He likes to ponder over anything which is important to him for
                  a long time â€” days, weeks or even months. When the African is
                  asked to make an important decision he does not believe in a
                  quick answer even if this should appear to him to be the
                  correct reply. He likes to "chew" the matter over carefully.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a son or daughter wishes to marry and have selected the
                  partner, they may not go direct to the father to inform him
                  for this is regarded as the height of disrespect. Instead they
                  must go to the sister of the father; tell her all about it and
                  she in turn will inform him. We can see the function of this
                  procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the son came to the father directly, the latter might
                  easily have become embarrassed and upset at the arrangement
                  and quarrel with his son over his choice. But by the procedure
                  of indirect approach, even if he is disapproving, he will have
                  calmed down after a few days and so be in a position to give a
                  more balanced decision one way or another as to the choice of
                  his son.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The same indirect approach is made when a disagreement breaks
                  out between a married couple sufficient to lead to a question
                  of separation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It would be wrong to approach either of the couple's parents
                  direct. It is necessary first for the
                  <abbr style="user-select: none" tip="vatete"
                    >husband's sister</abbr
                  >
                  of the particular one who wishes to make the first move, to
                  approach his or her <em>vatete</em> and she in turn will
                  consult with the corresponding parents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this way the parents have a chance to consider more
                  carefully any difficulty and, in a better frame of mind, may
                  be able to reach an equitable settlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It does not follow necessarily that the marriage will be saved
                  for either of the two may decide after notifying their
                  families through the vatete to report to the chief to dissolve
                  the marriage and so legalise the separation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona has been taught to be patient for it is no good
                  trying to force his brethren to a quick answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also likely to make for good relations between men is the
                  principle of reciprocation. It is practised by all Shona and I
                  doubt if it is ever omitted in life. Should a person do
                  something for another, no matter how small this act may be,
                  the benefactor should reciprocate, not necessarily with
                  something of equal value but as long as there is a token of
                  appreciation for what is done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this way good normal relationships between people are set
                  up. The Shona expects when he does an act of kindness or
                  goodness towards his fellow men that it should be
                  reciprocated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a man marries amongst the Korekore he has to pay his
                  father-in-law various sums in money or kind for looking after
                  the girl and paying for the medicines which kept her well as
                  she grew up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Amongst the Zezuru when the father-in-law goes to collect his
                  cattle, as he climbs the fence of the kraal to inspect the
                  cattle, he is given a small coin for doing this and also
                  another small coin for spending time looking at the cattle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona cannot live with acute tension within himself. He
                  must let it out. This may at first seem incongruous with the
                  man who is slow to anger and prefers to think slowly and
                  deliberately over his problems. But if the emotional tension
                  reaches above a certain level he must find a means of letting
                  out the steam.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this way he has his say and calm is more easily restored.
                  The Shona makes allowances for a person in this state. They
                  say it is right and proper for someone to speak his mind under
                  these circumstances in order to clear the air.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona believe in the power of confession. In fact, so
                  necessary is it to confess one's omissions or mistakes or
                  misdeeds that unless this is done illness and misfortune will
                  befall the guilty. Moreover if one confesses, even if sickness
                  has befallen one, recovery can still take place. It is never
                  too late to do this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a wife commits adultery and fails to confess this to her
                  husband, her child will fall ill. Therefore, should a child
                  fall ill and the husband is away when he hears of its illness
                  he at once becomes suspicious and might easily call upon his
                  wife to confess her sins for if she does this the child will
                  take a turn for the better and recover. We meet the power of
                  confession when a mother in labour fails to deliver herself of
                  her baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When anything abnormal like this happens the midwife and her
                  assistants at once become suspicious. She has misbehaved
                  herself and almost certainly they will think that the mother
                  has had relations with another man. So she is called upon to
                  confess her sin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If she does this it is certain, we are told, that the labour
                  will assume a normal course but if she refuses to do so she
                  will not only lose her baby but she herself will die.
                  Confession clears the air â€” and it pleases all concerned.
                  Forgiveness is more likely when confession and a statement of
                  regret is expressed. It causes tension to subside and normal
                  relations to be re-established.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is another "force" or influence which greatly affects
                  the behavior of the African. This is the "Power of Evil" which
                  the Bantu believe exists in certain people, a force which like
                  the "Creative Force", is passed on to the kin, a power so
                  prevalent that every person must be on guard against it.

                <p>
                  The witch is ever jealous, envious, and anyone who is rich,
                  boastful, proud or successful, or quarrels is bound to attract
                  the attention of the witch who will inflict untold sufferings,
                  misery and death upon that fortunate individual. Does this
                  force of evil come from the Creator? What does the African
                  think about this terrible force?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have asked this and I believe they do not link this force of
                  evil with the Creator or God, but that it arose countless
                  generations before in the group or clan of evil people and the
                  evil spirit, like the shavi or mudzimu, has been handed down
                  in the families. Belief by the African in the cult of evil
                  accounts for â€” as much as any factor â€” the great tendency to
                  conform.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Among the Makorekore people are the baboon spirits, the
                    <em>bveni shavi,</em> the only known instance of animal
                    spirit worship in southern Africa. The mediums who are
                    controlled by these spirits are expected to dress in a
                    certain way. The <em>murungu shavi,</em> for instance,
                    requires the chair, the enamel mug or cup and the clothes
                    typifying a white man (long trousers). A bveni shavi will
                    wear a cap of baboon fur, ask for peanuts and raw maize cobs
                    to eat.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Belief in ancestral spirits also accounts for conformity among
                  the Bantu. Belief in this vital force tends to force
                  individuals to behave in a similar manner as others do in this
                  society. It does not tend to spur on the society. The Shona
                  are clear when they state that the vadzimu are their
                  protectors who possess the power of preventing evil from
                  entering their midst in almost the role or guise of a
                  policeman.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These spirits are on guard, so to speak, around and in the
                  midst of their living quarters. In this way the witch can
                  never enter their homes and villages. In many ways the vadzimu
                  are spirits which are more feared and respected than loved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The awe of the Shona towards their vadzimu is very similar to
                  that of the Jew to God. It is this fear of the power of the
                  vadzimu which has the opposite effect of spurring on the
                  individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He is rather forced to conform, not to change, and to live in
                  the same way as his father and forefathers before him. The
                  cult of ancestors tends to create a static society.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus we meet two important forces which account for the desire
                  by the African to conform; the first is fear of the ancestral
                  spirits (vadzimu) and the second the fear of the evil spirits
                  in certain people (uroyi).
                </p>
                <p>
                  To the Shona, God is more in the nature of the very Great
                  Spirit, the Creator of all life who does not concern Himself
                  with every item or problem of a person's life â€” he is far
                  removed and his help is not invoked in the vast majority of
                  instances. For almost every problem or crisis the lesser
                  spirits are prayed to and invoked for their help in solving
                  the difficulty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whether this spirit is regarded as the same as God is to the
                  Christian, I much doubt, as this spirit is prayed to and
                  appealed to in the same way as the lesser spirits by giving it
                  presents of consecrated beer to drink and snuff to enjoy.

                      The influence of traditional concepts of the supernatural
                      and practices associated therewith remain very strong,
                      especially among those Africans who adopted strange forms
                      of Christianity, such as the Mapostori.

                  The Shona have a spiritual faith which in its basic principles
                  has much that the monotheist believes. On the other hand there
                  are very clear differences, the most striking being that the
                  religion in contributing to conformity lacks the
                  <abbr
                    style="user-select: none"
                    tip="the quality of being characterized by vigorous activity and progress"

                  >
                  of Christianity. All members of the clans are to be alike,
                  none richer than his fellow man in material culture, although
                  there are accepted differences in the social status in the kin
                  group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the religion does not encourage differences which would
                  affect the material status of a person. All are to possess
                  more or less the same, and all are to enjoy the material
                  benefits of life equally. Every man and woman must follow the
                  examples set by their grandparents or departed parents, on
                  this earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a person does not do what one's beloved elders did before
                  him, all will not be well. Should this individual show greed
                  and stray away from the course of life his parents practised,
                  nothing but trouble will follow. I have previously spoken of
                  this feature of Shona behavior as compulsory uniformity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is, in my opinion, the most outstanding feature of
                  African life â€” viz., to be like everyone else, to be just
                  normal. We notice this urge â€” almost amounting to an obsession
                  â€” for conformity in almost monotonous regularity in African
                  clothes, living quarters, utensils and so forth. Enter any
                  Shona village in a tribalised area and then compare it with
                  another in that area â€” one is forcibly struck by the sameness
                  throughout.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They do not seem to have developed any fashion, mode of dress
                  or in living. It is all the same and this appearance in the
                  society has been mistakenly attributed by outsiders and
                  observers to the fact that the African is incompetent,
                  backward, lazy and unambitious. NO! It means that the
                  individual has to live the life of his ancestors. My
                  contention is that no development is permitted beyond the
                  normal in so far as conduct is concerned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have found that the Shona has not encouraged the full
                  development of the individual's talent in matters vital to the
                  welfare of the clan. For instance, Shona philosophy has
                  discouraged the African from devising ways of storage or
                  impounding water so that in the event of a drought the
                  community can be saved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Shona it will be argued has changed from millet to maize
                  but by so doing no basic alterations have taken place in their
                  spiritual life with the transferring of the course of Nature.
                  There is to be no evolution, no change from the bare standards
                  which would ensure a normal mode of existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The aim and object to a happy existence is to live at peace
                  with Nature, to utilise the essentials which ensure a
                  reasonable standard of comfort. There is no need for instance
                  to have spring mattresses to sleep on for nothing can go wrong
                  if the individual sleeps on a reed mat on the ground. It is
                  much safer, more reliable to live simply â€” which after all is
                  only a matter of becoming accustomed to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This approach has been tried out, and as far as he can see, it
                  serves the purpose well. The Shona faith ensures conformity,
                  quite the reverse of Christianity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I believe that the religious faith of the Shona tends to make
                  all its adherents conform in behavior and outlook. Since one's
                  ancestors were good, kind and decent, the descendants should
                  be satisfied to follow their example. What is good for them is
                  good enough for the children. Let all men be equal with the
                  same opportunities and scope. No more, no less.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cult of witchcraft also tends to force man to be pleasant,
                  well behaved and to conform. The Shona therefore prefer the
                  normal man. They are not greedy nor do they want to be the
                  best or cleverest in the world. Their philosophy is not
                  towards dynamism. Their religion is static because change or
                  discovery means rivalry and rivalry means loss of friendship
                  amongst people and amongst clans and amongst nations war.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Peace can be preserved best by maintaining the status quo.
                  This is in marked contrast to Christianity which, while it
                  does call upon man to be content and happy with his lot gives
                  scope for change and indeed encourages progress. The
                  difficulty is where to draw the line in change and even
                  leading Christians are not a little concerned at the
                  innovations which are being introduced by many of the
                  scientific discoveries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Church has come to terms with scientific discovery,
                  through the genius of Thomas Aquinas of the sixteenth century.
                  The Christian could from then on with a better and clearer
                  conscience, be at peace about progress and its inevitable
                  change in his society and at the same time avoid a feeling of
                  guilt because of his faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This resistance to change was strong in Christian Europe some
                  500 years ago and I can quote no better example than that of
                  Michael Servitus who met his death at Geneva in 1553 because
                  he had the audacity to suggest another concept for the path
                  taken by the blood from the heart to the lungs and thus
                  supplant that of Galen whose hypothesis was accepted by the
                  Church as being correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Still the Church did not hold up all thought and there were
                  avenues open to men even in the Dark and Middle ages in which
                  scope for enterprise was permitted so long as Christian dogmas
                  did not suffer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the Shona there are no paths open for change. Conformity
                  was strictly enforced in all phases of conduct and behavior
                  and in ritual practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It must never be forgotten that there are even in European
                  societies very few geniuses. They are exceptional. No white
                  genius has as yet come out of any part of Africa. A bright man
                  is not a genius and almost all men quoted as being exceptional
                  are, strictly speaking, normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Normal mentality is a very fine attribute. Admittedly there
                  are degrees of normality among men and women, some being more
                  gifted or able than others, but the point I want to stress is
                  that most men and women we know are normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are, I think, far more normal Africans than normal
                  Europeans, as it is uncommon to meet many sub-normals in them.
                  A great number of Africans are bright and intelligent but this
                  is what has been encouraged in Africa. There have been fewer
                  geniuses than European ones over the ages, even though genius
                  is rare in European society.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The genius is apt to cause changes in the society because of
                  his discoveries. He is almost certain to meet opposition to
                  his revelations but as a rule his innovations are accepted,
                  even if grudgingly. All this is argument and hypothesis but a
                  genius would not be a welcome figure in African society.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He might easily forfeit his life and almost certainly if he
                  escaped with it, would be driven out. There is no place for
                  these men who come to alter the course of nature. So abnormal
                  a personality is much more likely to be labelled a witch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In European society the genius generally succeeds in making
                  his contribution even though he may be regarded as a danger in
                  the midst of his fellow men. It is difficult to quieten him.
                  He must burst forth and at all costs reveal his message. He
                  cannot be contained. His secret must be revealed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is quite possible that not only is the African more often
                  normal than the European but his physique is more normal. For
                  instance we find that almost all Africans have normal sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Africa the mode is far more towards normality, with less on
                  the extremes of normal. What impresses me so much about
                  African society is the quiet and serene behavior of the men
                  and women; their composure, their pleasant personality. In
                  their traditional way the African is quiet, never loud, never
                  boastful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It must not be forgotten that mysticism was accepted, indeed
                  flourished during the great Grecian and Egyptian cultures. All
                  Greece believed in the Oracles, in exorcism and in divination.
                  Despite their advanced culture as compared with the rest of
                  the world people believed that there were evil spirits ever
                  ready to penetrate their homes and destroy them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And despite this they achieved much, Similarly it cannot be
                  said that the failure of African culture to be progressive in
                  the European sense is due to witchcraft because despite it the
                  Greeks and Romans contributed to world knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It would be wrong however to believe that it was without
                  effect for as I have already stressed, the belief in this cult
                  must restrain many people from giving effect to their ideas
                  and this is enhanced when the religion has a similar effect on
                  the behavior of the individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The European, when he saw Africans living under natural
                  conditions, assumed that they were a backward race. He stood
                  back in amazement at this civilisation which he called
                  primitive. No one in fact doubted that they were primitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Social anthropologists until recently referred to the
                  tribesmen of Africa as being primitive. All the nations of
                  Europe looked on the African peoples as backward, and even
                  barbarian. But it did not stop there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mission stations sprang up and hundreds of brave Christians
                  perished from the tropical climate in the name of Christ.
                  Admittedly there were other reasons for the scramble for
                  Africaâ€”economic, political and so on. But no one can deny the
                  Christian motive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nor should it be underestimated as a factor. No missionary
                  even would give it a moment's thought and enquire whether the
                  African had a faith. If he did happen to give this matter
                  consideration then it was nothing more than witchcraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And so those well-meaning men and women gave devoted service
                  to the African who saw no reason why their ancient religion
                  should be discarded or its ritual be tampered with. But the
                  white man was not prepared to see the other man's point of
                  view.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not only did he insist on preaching the Gospel, but in his
                  concern to uplift the African he put up schools and hospitals.
                  Little did he realise that the African was as normal as he was
                  and as capable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the advance of Africa, many students of African life and
                  culture have come to realise that Africans are capable and
                  show ability comparable to the peoples of Europe. Given the
                  opportunity and relieved of their traditional religion and the
                  cult of witchcraft, there can be no doubt that the African
                  will take his place among the other nations of the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whilst I can see the virtues of the African's traditional
                  religion, I think the African nations in our modern era,
                  cannot afford to be bound down by conformity even though it
                  may not bring them happiness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rather turn to a faith which encourages change and dynamism
                  while at the same time teaching the same virtues of life, so
                  carefully indoctrinated in the Shona faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Students of religion may not hold that the Shona doctrine is
                  inferior to that of the Christian but I do not advocate its
                  adoption only because it forces man to follow too closely the
                  example set by his ancestors. The world today demands and
